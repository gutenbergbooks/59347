<span class="smaller">THE GAME</span></h3>

<p>Richards looked carefully over the table with the
eye of the well-trained manservant. He retouched
a bowl of lilac that offended against his slavish idea of
symmetry and then put a screen across the dying fire.</p>

<p>It was the end of May and the night was warm, but as
Carey Image was to be one of the guests that evening,
Richards had seen to it that the room was well heated.
For Carey Image had just come back from five years’
sojourn on the frontier of India, and Richards was afraid
that the rigours of the Eastern climate—particularly trying
to a man in the fifties—might strike a chill into his
sunbaked body. He was thinking about him as he placed
the screen, for Richards had been in the Currey family for
many years, and he remembered well the genial little man,
generous with his <i lang="fr">pourboires</i> and “full of pleasant remarks”—the
expression was Richards’ own, communicated
to his wife, the cook—who had been godfather to
the owner of the rooms thirty-two years ago, and had,
on the occasion of the christening, optimistically prophesied
that the baby would grow into a remarkable man.</p>

<p>Richards had heard the remark, and he now recalled it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
as he drew the curtains. Was not Carey Image’s prophecy
coming true? He had been the first in the field, if one
may use that expression of a prophet, but others now
began to endorse his opinion.</p>

<p>“Wonderful how he knew,” muttered Richards to himself,
“for babies is that alike, all pink and squally.”</p>

<p>Then by a natural sequence of thought Richards glanced
at a large photograph of his master in wig and gown
which reposed on a table, and which had been taken at the
request of his mother, who lamented afterwards that it
made him look too severe and old. A remarkable man?
No, the title was not yet earned; for no man is remarkable
until he is forty and has buried the prophet, his
godfather. Still, Gilbert Currey was well on the way to
success, and that very week had seen him take a big stride
forward. Had not his success in the Driver case made the
eyes of the legal profession and a good many of the public
turn towards him? Richards was old-fashioned enough
to take a pride in the fortunes of his master.</p>

<p>A slight noise through the curtains which shut off the
dining-room from the room in the front portion of the
flat caused the butler to turn. One of the guests had
arrived early. He must apologize for his master’s non-appearance.
Gilbert Currey was still dressing; he
generally rushed home from his chambers at the last
moment.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said a well-remembered voice, “it is the faithful
Richards. How do you do, Richards, and how have the
years treated you?”</p>

<p>Carey Image smiled genially, and Richards, as to an
old family friend, permitted himself an answering smile.</p>

<p>“I hope I see you well, sir.”</p>

<p>“Tolerably, Richards. My bones creak a little....
Ouf! Was it always the custom to make the rooms
so hot?”</p>

<p>Richards, crestfallen, explained. “I will open the
window wider.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, do. But it was thoughtful of you, Richards,
very thoughtful. It seems that everyone looks on me now
as a salamander.... So you are here with my godson
in his flat. How is that?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, when Mr. Gilbert came to live in town, my
mistress was anxious that I should look after him, so
my wife and I came up here.”</p>

<p>“Ah! let me see. Your wife made delicious omelettes.
I remember them well. So you came here to give him, as
it were, all the comforts of home. Lucky young dog.
I am confident of a good dinner now, for I was a little
doubtful, Richards, as I dressed. Gilbert is not an epicure,
or at least he was not five years ago. He eats—well,
he eats, and that’s all there is to it. I have come to the
age when I dine. And I remember your wife’s cooking.
Will you tell her so?”</p>

<p>The compliment pleased Richards and afterwards the
cook, as it was meant to. Image had been born with
the knack of saying the graceful thing in the right place,
and his memory was wonderful. This trick had made
many friends for him.</p>

<p>“I will tell my master you are here.”</p>

<p>“No, no, don’t hurry him. A party of five, eh? To
celebrate his birthday and his latest success at the Bar?
He <em>is</em> going to be a remarkable man.”</p>

<p>“I was just remembering what you said, sir, when
you came in.”</p>

<p>Image smiled, and taking off his glasses, carefully
polished them. “Ah! he was so sturdy and he shut his
little mouth so firmly—a great deal in the set of the mouth
even at the early age, Richards—and he knew what he
wanted so decidedly that I felt there was a career
before him. He commenced to orate loudly in church,
and I understand the same oration—more intelligible and
persuasive—won this much talked-of Driver case. Don’t
hurry him on my account. I have not yet become accustomed
to the taxi-cabs. Distances by rickshaws and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
distances by four-wheelers I know, but taxi-cabs—I find
myself hurrying along like the witch on her broomstick.”</p>

<p>Richards quietly withdrew, and Image surveyed the
rooms through his glasses, which made his near-sighted
brown eyes so extraordinarily brilliant and piercing. He
nodded in old acquaintanceship to several pieces of furniture
and a few pictures, for Gilbert’s mother had robbed
Wynnstay Manor for her son’s furnishing. On either side
of the fireplace were two new portraits which had been
painted since Image had been away. One represented a
woman, with delicate colouring and well-chiselled features.
The calm blue eyes were shallow as pools of water
in the sun, and there were no full curves to the lips or any
indication of deep emotion or temperament. A well-preserved
woman—Gilbert’s mother. On the other side
was a companion picture, Sir John Currey, Bart., M.P.
No weakness there, rather a dominating nature, an iron
will, a certain ruthlessness in the lines of the heavy jaw,
a certain coldness in the direct glancing eyes.</p>

<p>“A capital portrait, my old friend,” apostrophized
Image. “I wonder if Gilbert will——”</p>

<p>“Now, Carey, talking to the devil?” broke in a voice
on his meditations, a full, very masculine voice, that
filled the room. It made Image’s voice seem effeminate
and thin. “My old nurse used to say when she found me
muttering to myself that I was telling the devil too much
of my mind.”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, how glad I am to see you again. It’s
a silly habit of mine. I and myself, we often talk to one
another.... Let’s have a good look at you.... A
bit heavier——”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Gilbert laughing ruefully, “I am putting
on flesh. Don’t get enough exercise. You haven’t
changed, Carey.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I have definitely come to the shrivelled stage. I
was looking at your father’s portrait. Capital! When
you laugh you are not so like, but your face in repose—very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
like. I am glad to hear of your success, my boy.
Johnson Marks was in court yesterday, and he told me
your speech was truly remarkable for a young man, and
you know how many young barristers he has heard. You
must have been very pleased at the successful issue of
the trial.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I confess I was. I wanted to pull the thing off.
I made up my mind to get him acquitted.”</p>

<p>As he said it, the determined set of his mouth was old
beyond his years and reminded Image very powerfully of
his father. Then Gilbert smiled and clapped Image on
the back, and the impression of egoistic ruthlessness was
dissipated. When Gilbert Currey smiled he had considerable
charm. Women would have let him know this
if he had found time to court them.</p>

<p>Richards’ voice was heard at the door. “Mr. Iverson.”</p>

<p>“Hallo, old chap, flushed with victory, eh? Lord!
what a lot of swotting you must have done over that
case. Your knowledge of Eastern poisons knocked me
silly. You’re a nut, you are.”</p>

<p>No one could have mistaken Jack Iverson for anything
else but a Service man. As a matter of fact, he was in the
Blues, and exceptionally good-looking, with that rare distinction
in a man—a wonderful clear, healthy skin. His
eyes a curious jadelike green with the bluish clear whites
that one usually sees only in the eyes of a small child, Jack
Iverson was one of the handsomest and richest young
men that lounged about Mayfair.</p>

<p>Image did not know Jack Iverson, but he knew the next
guest, an old friend, Dr. Fritz Neeburg, and he had heard
of the last arrival, Gilbert’s particular friend and college
chum, Colin Paton.</p>

<p>The impression Paton made on the casual observer was
that of a well-groomed reserved man of a very English
type, and one of the best. There was nothing at all arresting
in his appearance; he had regular features, smooth
hair, well-cared-for hands, and a general air of wellbeing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
He was three years older than Gilbert, though they had
been at Oxford together, but he had been delicate in his
early manhood, and had spent several years in desultory
travel. Paton’s movements were all quietly deliberate;
they might have belonged to a man of fifty equally well
as to a man of thirty. He did not give the impression of
forceful energy, as did his friend. Quite unlike in character
and tastes, they were yet excellent friends, and
though Gilbert would have been at a loss to describe
or analyse Paton—he had no interest in psychology,
apart from its bearing on his legal work—Paton had long
ago realized the possibilities and the limitations of his
host.</p>

<p>They sat down to dinner in a pleasant intimate circle
of yellow light. Richards’ wife had a passion for flowers—she
would spend hours standing in front of the beautiful
florists’ displays in the West End, when she took her constitutionals—so
Gilbert’s rooms and table were always
tastefully decorated. This evening, heavy-headed, fragrant
jonquils, rather sick and drooping with their own
sweetness, nodded from some exquisite Venetian glass,
while bunched violets in silver bowls added to the spring-like
effect. Image was quick to notice the flowers.</p>

<p>“The English flowers! You must have spent ten years
in the tropics to appreciate them. One gets so satiated with
gorgeousness and overpowering perfume, just as one
gets tired of the burning sun and the eternal blue sky.
But the English flowers one never tires of. There is such
a wonderful simplicity and purity about them. They
refresh and cleanse one. In the East there are flowers
that are positively wicked, one almost starts back
from their viciousness. But the English flowers are
perfect.</p>

<p>“I saw your lights burning at two o’clock this morning,”
observed Neeburg; “were you celebrating your victory,
Gilbert?”</p>

<p>“No. I was working.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t overwork, old man. Don’t urge the willing
steed too fast and furious. I think we are all inclined to
do that nowadays. Faster and faster physical and mental
locomotion seems the order of the day.”</p>

<p>“And that’s how you rake in the guineas, Neeburg.
You shouldn’t grumble. But I’m as strong as a horse.
Work doesn’t hurt me. Thank God, I inherited a good
constitution from my father.”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, the strongest horse, if you overwork
him, will sometimes go lame. You’ve been working very
hard the last couple of years. Keep things in their proper
proportions—that’s the secret of life and happiness—proportion!”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Image briskly, “that’s very true, Fritz,
only we usually learn that secret when it’s too late and
everything is out of proportion.”</p>

<p>“Proportion!” said the host quickly. “How can you
keep a sense of proportion nowadays? Look at me. When
you start in the legal profession the proportion is on the
wrong side. You have nothing to do except to wear out
the leather chairs at your chambers. Get a move on and a
few eyes directed to you, and you are very soon swamped
with work. And if a man doesn’t work for all he is
worth with a singleness of aim and ambition between
twenty-five and forty, he will never arrive. You have to
keep your nose to the grindstone or success will pass you
by. It’s all very well for doctors to talk of moderation
and a sense of proportion, but how can you be moderate?
Life is immoderate nowadays.”</p>

<p>“You mean that a man’s ambitions and wants are
immoderate,” returned Neeburg.</p>

<p>Jack Iverson, who was quite frankly out of the conversation,
tried to contribute his quota. “I say, what’s the
good of spending all the days of your youth swotting?”
he said in his rather rich, lazy voice. “The game isn’t
worth the candle.”</p>

<p>Gilbert went on a trifle impatiently. “The thing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
do nowadays is to specialize. Make up your mind what
you can do best, and what you want, and hang on like a
bulldog till you get it.”</p>

<p>“A bit of a gamble if you only stake on worldly
success,” said Paton quietly.</p>

<p>Image nodded emphatically, and looked curiously from
one young man to the other.</p>

<p>“It isn’t such a gamble. I believe most firmly that
you can ensure success provided that you have certain
abilities and a fair constitution. You hear a lot of people
blaming Fate for their non-success in life. How many of
them have really striven whole-heartedly to get what they
want? The road to success is a sort of obstacle race, and
you can’t afford, while you are surmounting the obstacles,
to either look to the right or the left or even behind you,
to see who is possibly going to overtake you. Success isn’t
a chance; it’s a certainty if you concentrate.” Gilbert
had a very decisive manner, which was worth its weight
in gold to him in the courts.</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence as he ceased speaking.</p>

<p>“Yes, but my dear boy,” said Image at length, “what
is success?”</p>

<p>“Making money, I suppose,” said Jack Iverson, watching
Richards refill his glass. He was glad that he did not
do any of these strenuous things. He had a secret awe
and lazy admiration of Gilbert.</p>

<p>“No,” said his host, “you generally make money if you
are successful—it follows as the night the day—but I
should say that very few of the world’s successful men
have worked for the sake of money.”</p>

<p>“Well, how do you define it? Notoriety, fame, the
applause of undiscriminating men who shout with the
crowd, paragraphs in the halfpenny papers side-by-side
with an account of the latest high kick of a popular actress,
a long obituary notice to be followed by a badly-written
book of biography by one of the family which nobody
reads—is that worth struggling for?” Paton put the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
question quietly, his voice a trifle colourless after Gilbert’s.</p>

<p>“<em>You</em> are not ambitious,” retorted Gilbert. “You
never were. You have always let other fellows walk over
you, chaps with half your brains. You dream your time
away.”</p>

<p>“No, excuse me, I don’t dream. I hate excessively to
hear myself classed with those vague, anæmic brains that
wander like will-o’-the-wisps over the world. You think I
wasted my time at Oxford because I did not take any
degree. I don’t. I taught myself how to think. I refused
to cram my brains with facts most of which would be
of little use to me in after-life, or to my neighbour. I
tried to leave a little room for the imagination. Oxford
appealed to my imagination, and I think I have brought
something away from her that will be a precious possession
all my life. You came away with an enormous capacity
for assimilating knowledge, with a well-trained memory
and a habit of pigeonholing everything and everybody.
Most useful to you in your profession, my dear fellow,
but it did not appeal to me as worth working for.”</p>

<p>“You have no ambition to be labelled ‘successful’?” said
Image, who had been watching Paton as he spoke with
his brilliant dark eyes. He found something that he liked
in Paton, something which he vaguely missed in Gilbert
and had always missed in his father before him.</p>

<p>“I don’t care for what is usually called success. Of
course, many people say that because they know they
won’t set the world on fire; and in spite of what Gilbert
says, there are people who will never, with any amount of
concentration, arrive; but, honestly, I don’t much care
what my fellow-creatures think of me from the point of
view of worldly success—I care very much otherwise;
and I refuse to try and narrow myself down within the
cramped little borders of success. I want room to develop,
and I don’t want to be forced through the world’s mill
and come out in a certain pattern.”</p>

<p>“And Gilbert doesn’t care a pin what people think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
him ‘otherwise,’ but very much from the world’s stand-point,
that’s the difference between you,” said Neeburg,
helping himself to a quail <i lang="fr">en cocotte</i>. “Now, I wonder
which makes for happiness?”</p>

<p>“Oh, hold on!” cried Gilbert, laughing. “I like people
all right. I protest, Neeburg.”</p>

<p>Neeburg smiled and shook his head. “Individuals are
not really necessary to you,” persisted Neeburg.</p>

<p>“I won’t be made out a hard and miserable materialist
just because I am honest enough to say I am
ambitious.”</p>

<p>“My dear boy, there are many like you,” said Neeburg;
“and ambition is by no means a bad thing. But with
you the game is the thing. You are the type of man who
lives and dies in harness. Men and women are pawns
in the game of life to you. Once I thought as you do,
but I was checked in time. And I found it wasn’t worth
while. Bay-leaves may be bitter.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Image; “to every man his own meat and
his own poison. I’ve met a good many famous men
in my time, and I can’t recall that any of them seemed
to be particularly happy. To be great is to be lonely....
How delicious these strawberries are!... I think
I’d rather be one of the common herd. The big man
looks over the heads of others in a crowd, but he misses
a lot of friendly glances and intimate whispers. I even
like some of the jolly, familiar nudges one gets. No one
would dare to nudge a great man.”</p>

<p>The others laughed, and Richards came in with the
coffee.</p>

<p>“That reminds me of something that was said to me
yesterday,” said Neeburg, “by an Anglo-Indian just come
home. Was no end of a pot in India with absolute control
over a big province. He was lamenting that it was
horrible to find himself obliged to use buses and sit next
to—just anybody!”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t appreciate the nudges,” laughed Gilbert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s forgotten how jolly they are,” retorted Image,
with a twinkle. “That’s just what I complain of.”</p>

<p>Jack Iverson, who had been vainly trying to follow
“those brainy fellows,” broke in with a commonplace.
“Well, I hate the people you see in buses and tubes.
They think they are as good as you, and they always
seem in such a beastly hurry to get somewhere. And,
all the time, I suppose most of ’em don’t do anything
in particular.”</p>

<p>“No, they only earn their livings,” said Neeburg drily.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad I don’t have to,” said Iverson, lighting
his cigar. “I’d rather have money than brains. I say,
I’ve got to rush off soon, Gilbert. Claudia insisted that
I must go to Lady Laud’s dance at the ‘Ritz.’ Rotten
fag, bunny-hugging and Gaby-gliding.”</p>

<p>“Is your sister going too?” asked Gilbert quickly.</p>

<p>“Claudia? Yes. I suppose you got an invitation?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I had forgotten all about it.”</p>

<p>“Dancing is a beastly bore. I’m fed up with it,”
continued Iverson complacently, his striking good looks in
obvious contrast to his commonplace mind. “I’d rather
play bridge any day, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t dislike dancing, only I can’t afford the
time. If I go to a dance I always stay too late. And I
certainly should if I danced with your sister.”</p>

<p>“Not half a bad dancer, is she? She goes on at me for
being too lackadaisical. She says she likes a partner who
<em>feels</em> the music. But how can you feel the <cite>Chocolate
Soldier</cite> every night, and what are you to feel? Quite
imposs. I can’t understand all these delicate sort of
feelings. They were playing ‘The Rosary’ the other night
at supper, and the girl with me put on such a die-away
air that I thought she felt sick. She was awfully annoyed
with me for offering her some brandy.”</p>

<p>There was a general laugh as the men moved away from
the table. The noise of the traffic outside was like a huge
buzzing bee; the fresh air, holding a subtle promise of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
spring, came in through the open casement windows.</p>

<p>Iverson was the first to break up the party. “Claudia
will go for me if I don’t get there in decent time.”</p>

<p>Fritz Neeburg went with him. He never kept late
hours, for the hand of the surgeon must be steady and
there must be no overnight fogs in his brain. Presently
Carey Image, Paton and their host, were alone together.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="I_CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">CIRCE’S DAUGHTER</span></h3>

<p>“Well, I’ve been an unsuccessful man as the world
counts success,” said Image, as though the thread
of their early conversation had never been broken, “but
I’ve had fifteen years of great personal happiness. Can
one expect more than that in life? Could I have been
more successful? And I’ve laid up a store of beautiful
memories for my old age.”</p>

<p>Everyone knew the story of Carey Image. He had
himself started out in life at the Bar. When in his thirty-second
year and well on the road to be a K.C., he was
briefed as counsel in a divorce case. The woman was
unsuccessful in divorcing her husband, the definition of
legal cruelty did not cover practices and habits that had
reduced a beautiful, healthy woman to a frightened
shadow; but she was successful in winning a heart that
had stood between her and the world for fifteen years
afterwards. Pariahs in social London—for in those days
public opinion was more cruel than it is to-day—they
had wandered all over the world together. They had not
been quite idle, for she helped Image to write several
books of thoughtful travel that had first set the fashion
of “wander literature.” She had died five years previously,
and never once had Image regretted what he had
given up for her. He had rescued a woman from the
lowest depths and made her perfectly happy. His worldly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
failure in life had been his real success. The look in the
dying woman’s eyes as they had turned to him had made
an imperishable crown.</p>

<p>Gilbert was silent. As a child he had known Image,
and he had often wondered since if it had really been
worth while to make a pariah of himself. He was
answered now. It was so different from his mother’s
version of the good-looking woman who got Image in her
clutches and whom he was too unworldly to see
through.</p>

<p>“I think that fifteen years of happiness is more than
most of us can hope for,” said Paton quietly.</p>

<p>“I remember as a boy,” said Image reminiscently,
“being asked what I wanted to do in life, and I replied
‘To do one thing well and make one person happy.’ I
think I did the latter, but in the first I have failed. My
globe-trotting books are pretty well known, but what are
they, after all?” He looked at the portrait of Gilbert in
his wig and gown, and there was a sort of gentle regret in
his eyes.</p>

<p>“Surely you have been successful in both,” said
Paton. “To love well—isn’t that one of the rarest
talents?”</p>

<p>Image turned on him with his charming smile. “Ah!
but it was so easy. If you had known her you would
realize it was nothing to my credit—nothing at all.” He
said it very simply, as though stating an undeniable fact.
For a moment there was silence, while the ghost of a
beautiful, sweet-natured woman passed through the
room.</p>

<p>Then Gilbert, who, like most Englishmen, felt rather
uncomfortable at the sentimental vein into which they
had fallen, poured himself out a whisky and soda, and
the prosaic hiss of the syphon dispelled the ghost.</p>

<p>“Well, I must be going,” said Paton, rousing himself
from a little reverie and slowly getting out of the big
armchair; “time for all good children, et cetera. Good-night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Mr. Image, I am very pleased to have met you. I
hope we shall meet again.”</p>

<p>“We are sure to,” said Image cordially. “I wish you
would come and lunch with me at my club one day?
You will? Good. I’ll drop you a line. Good-night
to you.”</p>

<p>Gilbert went to see him out, and Image, rising, looked
again at the photograph of him which his mother said
was too severe. As Gilbert came back to the room he
compared the original with the photograph. More than
a presentable man, Gilbert Currey was distinctly good-looking.
The brow was broad and high, and the hair
grew thick and strongly. His eyes, which Image remembered
in the baby had been blue like his mother’s, were
now a darkish grey and the lids fell rather heavily over
them. This, however, did not give any impression of
sleepiness, rather that of self-sufficiency and reserve
force. The nostrils of his well-shaped nose were somewhat
wide, denoting his energy and driving power. The
chin was rather too heavy, and had he not closed his
mouth so firmly the lips would have been a trifle sensual.
Above the medium height, he gave promise of being
one day a heavy man if he did not exercise sufficiently,
but now he was still well-proportioned. The two men
were physically a great contrast, for Carey Image was
always known as “little Carey Image,” though the
diminutive indicated affection as well as size. He had
the small build and fineness of the Japanese.</p>

<p>“Well, cousin Carey,” laughed Gilbert as he met the
ruminative gaze of the brown eyes, “sizing me up, eh?
Find me much changed?” He took out a pipe and
commenced to fill it.</p>

<p>“No, very little, surprisingly little. You’re going to
be like your father. How is he?”</p>

<p>“Well, and fiercely combating socialism and all the
other revolutionary ‘isms.’ You can imagine how much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
he likes the democratic tendency of the times. He gets
grimmer over them every time we meet.”</p>

<p>Image smiled. “Yes, politically I find a great change
in England since I left it. But it’s interesting—very....
Your friend Paton is very charming. What does he
do?”</p>

<p>“That’s a difficult question to answer. I can’t reply
“nothing,” because he is always doing something. Much
more energetic than he looks. His father is urging him
to go into Parliament, and I think he will later on. But
at present he says he is ‘informing himself,’ whatever
that may mean. He is helping Sir John Tollins with his
Prison Reform Crusade at the moment, and he is visiting
various institutions all over the country.”</p>

<p>“Ah! yes, a sociologist. Such men do very useful
work. And what is Mr. Jack Iverson?”</p>

<p>“A rich young ass,” laughed Gilbert.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Carey with a twinkle; “that is not information.
I can see into shop windows as well as
you.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s in the Blues; but I always think of him
as Claudia’s brother.” He said it without the slightest
embarrassment, just as he might have referred to his own
uncle.</p>

<p>“Claudia! A pretty name. Is she as pretty as her
name?”</p>

<p>“Prettier. But they are a wonderfully handsome
family. Looks on both sides.”</p>

<p>Image lit another of his French cigarettes, and then
he said gently, “And have you any designs on the pretty
sister?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Gilbert, with a curious thoughtful deliberation.
“I think—I think I shall marry her.”</p>

<p>A look flashed into his godfather’s eyes at the—to him—curious
way in which a young man expressed his intention
of asking a woman to confer the greatest honour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
upon him. But the modern young man was always astounding
Carey Image and making him wonder if he
had lost his bearings in India or if some mischievous god
had deliberately turned things upside down.</p>

<p>“I was going to ask you if you had any plans other
than worldly.... Is Miss Iverson likely to do you the
honour to——?”</p>

<p>Gilbert broke in rather abruptly. The subtle reproof
had passed him by, immersed as he was in his own
thoughts. “You know the family? Mrs. Iverson was
Sybil Daunton-Pole, and Geoffrey Iverson is Lord
Creagh’s third son.”</p>

<p>“Why, of course; I wondered why the name was
familiar.” A light broke in on him and he became
animated. “I remember—why, yes. She was the woman
who made such a sensation when she was first presented,
and her portrait was painted as Circe and exhibited
at the Academy? A lovely creature.”</p>

<p>Gilbert nodded. “Time has taken his toll now.”</p>

<p>Image was searching back many years. “Let me see,
and wasn’t she supposed to be a Circe in real life? Wasn’t
there a story about her and a member of Parliament——?”</p>

<p>“Oh! a hundred stories. One of the most talked-of
women in London.”</p>

<p>“A certain Royal personage was supposed——”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s always said so.... I should say she has had
a high old time. Iverson never tried to control her. Of
course, as I say, she’s a bit <i lang="fr">passée</i> now. She knows it,
too, and has taken up with occultism, mysticism, or whatever
you call it. ‘I must occupy myself,’ she said to me
the other day. ‘I have decided definitely to retire from
the stage of Love while I am still desirable. My children
bore me. I will seek the occult.’”</p>

<p>“Not an ideal mother for a girl,” said Image.</p>

<p>“Oh! Claudia is all right. Here’s her photo. She
promised it to me if I won the Driver case. It only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
came this morning.” He took it out of a drawer and
handed it to Image. In the corner was written in a firm
individual hand, “Best congratulations, Claudia.”</p>

<p>“Beautiful,” said Image warmly, who was ever an
admirer of all things lovely, especially women. “I think
I have met her somewhere. Not at all like I remember
the portrait of Circe.”</p>

<p>“Not a scrap like her mother. A good deal of what
the French call <i lang="fr">beauté du diable</i> about Mrs. Iverson.
Claudia’s look are quite different.”</p>

<p>Image began to recall various tit-bits of scandal and
gossip that had found their way out to India regarding
Claudia’s mother. Utterly unmoral, passionately heartless,
the fascinations of a siren, Image had heard many
tales of her. He recalled vaguely one story, which was
particularly scandalous and which questions the paternity
of one of the daughters. There had been whisper at that
time that she had gone too far, and weak, complaisant
Geoff Iverson would be roused to divorce her.</p>

<p>“Miss Iverson is dark, I should say? Yes, I thought
so.” Image looked at the girl in the portrait, who looked
back at him. She had adopted no coquettish pose, no
drooping eyelids or heavenward gaze, but she looked
straight out of the frame with her clear, fine eyes. And
they seemed to Image to be asking innumerable questions
of life. There was a suggestion, too, of eagerness about
the mobile lips, as though they would open and presently
shape the word “why?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit like her mother.” Gilbert seemed to take
a comfort in repeating it. “And although there is all this
talk about heredity nowadays, such a woman as Circe is
something unusual. Of course, if I thought——”</p>

<p>“My dear boy, can you be in love with her and stop
to think it over in this way?” Image was a little impatient
with his godson. He liked the girl with the questioning
eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Gilbert looked up in slow surprise. “Well, mother
doesn’t like Mrs. Iverson, as you may imagine. She calls
her that ‘dreadful, immoral woman.’ And you know
what mothers are. She’s carefully picked out a girl for
me. Plenty of money, and influential family relations.
But the girl annoys me: she is one of the clinging, sentimental
sort. I don’t think I could stand her as my
wife.”</p>

<p>“Why—why are you marrying?” said Image slowly.
Gilbert had evidently consulted his mother, or at least
listened to her counsels. In some way Image was old-fashioned
in his ideas of what is due to a parent, but he
had never held it right that a mother should select a
wife for her son.</p>

<p>“Why?” Gilbert knocked the ashes out of his pipe.
“Well, I think it is about time.”</p>

<p>“I see.” Image looked again at the photograph. Gilbert
was only marrying because “it was about time.” What
were the eager dark eyes asking for? Only for that?
“You don’t believe in having any sentiment about
choosing one’s life partner?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, of course. I’ve just told you the girl my
mother has picked out would annoy me no end. I like
Claudia very much. Only she is in a bad set, though it
doesn’t seem to have affected her. As a matter of fact,
her mother has hardly had any intercourse with her. She
has none of the domestic virtues, you know. As far as
one can see there is no taint there, but—well, its a serious
responsibility to marry the daughter of a Circe. And
people talk so much about heredity and eugenics——”</p>

<p>“My dear boy,” said Image heatedly, “love snaps its
fingers at heredity and pulls a long nose at eugenics.
To the devil with them, I say. It’s too much talk about
these things that makes people so anæmic these days.
If you love a woman, take her in your arms and keep her
there. A good woman won’t want to go far astray. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
keep her in your arms. Don’t put them round her once
and hold her tight till she says ‘yes’ and then loosen hold.
Most Englishmen deserve to lose their wives.” Image
spoke with such warmth that Gilbert smiled.</p>

<p>“A champion of woman!” He took the photo from
Image. For the first time a tinge of warmth crept into
his voice. It may have been caught from Image. “She
is handsome, isn’t she?”</p>

<p>“No, I do not stand up as a champion of women. I
would not dare to do such a thing. But, thank God, I
was brought up to love and respect women and to think
that they needed protection and guarding. And men are
all the better for the responsibility.”</p>

<p>“Women nowadays resent guarding and protecting.
They’ve changed while you’ve been away.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, I don’t believe it. They resent bullying
and spying and the things that are done under the name
of protection. They may <em>pretend</em> to like guarding and
protecting themselves, but it’s because their men-folk are
such incompetent slacksters. You modern lovers, what
you miss in life! Don’t be a fool, Gilbert. You are in
love with her, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes, I have a feeling that way.” Gilbert gave
a little laugh to cover his confession. For Image’s enthusiasm
was infective. And really Claudia was very
charming. What a good hostess she would make. And
she was quick to see things; her fine eyes had a wonderful
way of lighting up—one of the gifts of the gods;
she was interested in his career——</p>

<p>Image rose and clapped him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you put on your dancing-pumps and go
off and dance with her to-night? I daresay she’ll cut
out some unfortunate fellow for you.”</p>

<p>Gilbert considered. “I must go down to my chambers
early to-morrow, and I wanted to read over a brief to-night.
Still, I might go for an hour. After all——” He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
broke off and put his pipe on the mantelpiece. After all,
he had been celebrating a victory and his birthday. He
had the feeling that he might allow himself a little treat.
Claudia would be surprised and, he thought, pleased to
see him. It was always easy to see her emotion mirrored
in her eyes.... Yes, he would treat himself.</p>

<p>Image said good-night and went down in the lift. He
was thinking of Gilbert, a little puzzled, a little regretful,
of what he hardly knew—and he flashed back a glance to
his own youth.</p>

<p>He stood still for a moment in the warm spring air
and looked up at the stars. Then he took off his hat and
for a moment stood bareheaded, as before a shrine.</p>

<p>“I’m very glad,” he said softly; but why he was glad
no one but himself knew, unless it were the stars.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="I_CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">THE WORLD, THE FLESH——</span></h3>

<p>The dance was at its height when Gilbert entered
the ball-room. He thought of Jack Iverson’s protest
as the strains of the waltz from the <cite>Count of Luxembourg</cite>
began to float over the room, played as only a
Viennese orchestra can play it. Yet the strains were
alluring to that part of him that was not the successful
barrister, and his feet itched like any ordinary young
man’s to be dancing. Claudia, of course, would be
booked up—she was, as her brother had left unsaid,
a beautiful dancer—and no matter who went short of
partners, Claudia did not. She had been out a year, and
rumour said that she had had a good many offers of
marriage. An aunt, who was anxious to see her settled,
had said, with annoyance, that Claudia must be waiting
for a prince.</p>

<p>Gilbert caught sight of Jack Iverson dancing with a
pretty débutante who was too plainly desirous of winning
his approval. The only son, he was in the curious position
of being wealthier than his own father, for an aunt,
who had in the sixties married an immensely rich Jew,
had recently died and left all her fortune to him. Why,
heaven knows, unless she thought that the money would
be put into quick circulation. This made young Iverson
a very desirable <i lang="fr">parti</i> in the matrimonial market, and
mothers of budding and blooming daughters were extremely
polite to him. But Jack Iverson’s taste did not
lie in the drawing-rooms of Mayfair.</p>

<p>Gilbert waited about, but he could not see Claudia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
He turned away, more disappointed than he would have
owned, and there, under a big palm, tapping her fan
impatiently on her knee, he saw her—alone.</p>

<p>“Claudia,” he said, going quickly up to her, “are you
not dancing this?” He called all the Iverson family by
their Christian names. He had known them in his early
youth, when their country house had adjoined his
father’s. When Claudia was ten, their house had been
sold—it was too far from town—and it was only during
the last few months that he had really renewed his acquaintance
with the family. Lady Currey had been unfeignedly
glad when the Iversons moved away.</p>

<p>Claudia jumped up, all animation. “You here! I
thought you couldn’t afford the time for such frivolities.”</p>

<p>“I can’t really, but I’ve come for an hour. I wondered
if there was a chance of getting a dance with you.” The
music was humming in his ears, there was a heady odour
from a group of lilies beside them, and—and Claudia
was glad to see him. “I should not have come otherwise,”
he added. He smiled at her, and though he used the smile
very seldom, it was quite attractive.</p>

<p>She met his eyes squarely without the least bit of
a flutter, but a faint flush rose to her smooth cheeks.
“Well, come,” she said, putting her hand within his arm.
“I am engaged for this—but my partner has kept me
waiting. So he can lose the dance. A laggard dancer,
like a laggard lover, deserves to lose his partner.”</p>

<p>“Blessings on his laggardism.”</p>

<p>“If I had been an Early Victorian maiden, I should
have waited patiently, like a brown paper parcel, till he
came to claim me.... Ah, well! You dance much better
than he does. He dances like a pair of animated fire
tongs.”</p>

<p>Some people dance, and others move their feet. Claudia
would have inspired an elephant to tread coquettishly.
She had the real spirit of the dance in her, and a magnetism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
that communicated itself to her partners, no
matter how stodgy and how deep one foot was in the
grave. An old colonel had once said—he was turned
sixty, and out of pure good nature she had danced with
him—that it was too dangerous to dance with Claudia
Iverson. “I can’t afford to regret my youth so bitterly.”
Circe had had a good deal of magnetism in her youth,
but it had been purely animal. With Claudia it was a
tantalizing blend of spirit and body.</p>

<p>For some time they waltzed in silence. Then Gilbert
said involuntarily, “I’m glad I came.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad, too,” said Claudia softly. A little strand
of soft dark hair that had become unloosened swept his
cheek now and again, her body gave to every movement,
lithe, supple and warm. He forgot his career and the
brief he had meant to study. His youth asserted itself—he
had never really enjoyed it—and insolently told his
maturer intellect to hold off and take a back place.</p>

<p>But Claudia, like most women, could think of many
things while she was thoroughly enjoying the dance, for
women can do several things at the same time. She was
thinking of his triumph the day before. Many people
had been talking about him the last few days, and prophesying
big things for him. He was the young man of
the hour, and he had left his work to come and dance
with her. The thought was intoxicating.</p>

<p>Claudia was desperately tired of the men who did nothing.
Her father did nothing—he sat on one or two boards,
and grumbled at having to attend their monthly meetings—her
brother did very little. Although he was in the
army, his duties sat lightly upon him, and those duties
seemed to involve little or no brain power. Jack confessed
that the only time he thought was the few minutes
when he was sitting in his bath in the morning. The man
with whom she should have danced the waltz did nothing.
He was vaguely going in for politics one day, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
meantime he gracefully and idly existed. Most of the men
Claudia knew, except one or two elderlies who were M.P.’s
or the heads of large companies, did nothing in particular.
And Claudia had a great admiration for the people
who did things. As a girl, she had read all the biographies
of famous men that she could lay her hands upon,
and she had even once had a desire to do something big
herself. Though she had long ago given up the idea, she
still admired the vigorous men who did and thought
strongly.</p>

<p>The dance came to an end and Gilbert led her out of
the room.</p>

<p>“I was in court yesterday,” said Claudia, tucking the
little strand of hair tidily away under the fillet of pink
coral and pearls which she wore. She was dressed in a
pastel shade of something diaphanous and soft, that
harmonized exactly with the creamy tones of her skin.
The only colour about her was supplied by the corals
which she also wore wound in strands round her neck
and drooping over the front of her corsage.</p>

<p>“No, were you?” said Gilbert, thrilling at this evidence
of her interest.</p>

<p>“I made Uncle John take me.... I had to bribe him
by promising to go and play backgammon with him two
afternoons this week. But it was worth it. I—well, I
should have howled if you hadn’t won the case, I was so
excited. Uncle John went to sleep and snored, and he
says I’ve pinched him black in my indignation. Isn’t it
dreadful to be old and not be interested in anything for
more than half an hour? He said it was the air of the
courts.”</p>

<p>“I did make a long speech though. Did you realize
I was speaking for two hours? You were not there all
that time?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I was. Uncle John went to get something to
eat, but I never budged.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“Claudia, how sweet of you.” He came a little nearer
to her and his nostrils dilated a little. No man is unmoved
by the subtle flattery of a beautiful woman, and
Claudia was looking her best that night.</p>

<p>“But,” said Claudia, with an abrupt change of voice,
“I wish the man, the prisoner, had been more worth it.
An awful poor thing, wasn’t he? Even if he didn’t
murder the boy, he was only a wisp of straw, wasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“If men and women were all fine strong characters,
my services wouldn’t be required, would they?”</p>

<p>Claudia looked thoughtful, and the brown eyes
seemed to grow larger and brighter, as though some
lamp were burning behind them. “No, I suppose you
live on people’s weaknesses and lack of morals and
stamina. Oh! dear, I don’t like to think that.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t think it. Don’t let’s talk about my work.
Tell me what you have been doing since I saw you last
week?”</p>

<p>She was leaning a little forward, her elbow on her
knee, and he could see the rise and fall of her bosom,
the soft curves outlined by the clinging chiffon. And
though he sat outwardly unmoved, something tingled
within him and strained like a dog in a leash.</p>

<p>Claudia sat up with a shrug of her shoulders. It was a
little trick of hers that suited her dark eyes. “I have
been gloriously doing nothing in particular, the same
things as I did last year, meeting much the same people
and talking much the same talk. I spent two afternoons
helping at the Duchess’s bazaar, and I smiled a continuous
persuasive smile from ear to ear all the time, and
I told a great many lies trying to sell things that were of
an unutterable hideousness, and that nobody could want
to buy. There was such a funny man came up to me. I
tried to sell him a poker-work photo frame. ‘Isn’t it
charming?’ I murmured. ‘Madam,’ he said, with a little
twisty smile that began in his eyes and came down to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
lips, ‘if you will frankly tell me what you think of it, I
will purchase it. Your tone lacks conviction.’ ‘Sir,’ I
replied, ‘frankly I think it one of the ugliest things I
have ever seen and nothing would induce me to have it
in my room.’ ‘How much?’ said he. And he bought it.
I should like to meet him again. I am sure we should be
friends.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what he did with it?” laughed Gilbert.
“Perhaps he put his worst enemy into it.”</p>

<p>“If I ever see him again I shall ask him.... Have
you heard about Pat? She has run away from Germany
and come home. She says that speaking the Teutonic
language all day was spoiling the shape of her mouth,
and there was something in the air or the water that she
was sure was making her figure spread! Isn’t she too
quaint? She announces that she has learnt quite enough
for the present, and she insists that mother shall bring
her out.”</p>

<p>“Why, she’s quite a child, surely!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! Patsy is—let me see—nearly eighteen.
Mother is so annoyed. You see I keep out of her way,
but Pat is noisy about the house. She finds Pat absolutely
antagonistic to—well to the spooks and the thought
waves. She had hoped Pat would stay over in Germany
for six months and acquire a philosophic language. Pat
informed mother yesterday that she knew her type of
good looks went off early, and she advised mother to
get her safely off-hand before she began to fade.”
Claudia laughed heartily at the remembrance. “She’s
awfully pretty. You don’t remember her?”</p>

<p>“I remember a small child with forget-me-not eyes and
flaxen hair, who was always sitting down heavily on
choice seedlings in the flower-beds and then crying because
she had ‘hurted them.’”</p>

<p>“Yes, that was Patsy. But she’ll get married quite
easily. She’s really sweet. She’s got little tricks with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
her eyes, quite natural, not affected—and her eyebrows
go up in a funny way that makes her look like an intelligent
cock robin. By the way, have robins got eyebrows?
They seem eyebrows all over, don’t they? Oh! Pat will
make a hit when she comes out.”</p>

<p>Gilbert looked at her curiously. Did Claudia not think
about getting married? He hazarded a question in a
bantering, rather intimate way.</p>

<p>“And when are you going off?”</p>

<p>“It sounds like a firework, doesn’t it? I don’t mind
telling you in a burst of confidence that Aunt Lucretia
thinks the squib is a little damp. It hasn’t gone bang
yet! But Pat will make a brilliant firework. Mind you
don’t get burnt.”</p>

<p>The music had struck up again, and Claudia took up
her programme with a faint sigh.</p>

<p>Gilbert put his hand over the little white-gloved one
that held the card. “Who are you dancing with? Never
mind who it is. Throw him over. Yes,” he said firmly,
as she protested, “I know it isn’t your usual habit. But—well,
isn’t it a special night somehow? It’s my birthday
for one thing and——”</p>

<p>“Oh, is it? Many happy returns. You got my photograph
this morning?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s on my mantelpiece now.... Never mind the
wretched programme.”</p>

<p>“But what shall I say?” she protested laughingly, for,
womanlike, she loved a high-handed man who insists on
getting his own way.</p>

<p>“Say—say you prefer to dance with me.... Isn’t it
true, Claudia? Say it is.”</p>

<p>One hand was quite lost in his. His compelling eyes
were on her face. Something for an instant caught her
by the throat and made her shut her eyes as she said
almost under her breath, “Yes, it’s true.”</p>

<p>They made their way back to the ball-room. More<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
than one man stopped to congratulate Gilbert, and a
good many women smiled up at him invitingly.</p>

<p>As far as Claudia knew, Gilbert never flirted. She
had never heard his name coupled even lightly with that
of any woman. And he was thirty-two! It was almost
unique in her set, where sexual philandering is one of
the most amusing games for passing the time. She did
not realize that it was precisely for lack of time that he
had not paid much attention to women. The Law had
been his only love. Claudia was a little tired and contemptuous
of the hurrying, bee-like gentleman who sips from
many flowers with no distinct preference for any bloom.
Many such had buzzed around her, but she had kept fast
closed the petals of her heart. But Gilbert Currey was
different; yes, he was certainly different.</p>

<p>A pale-faced, vapid youth, the heir to a famous dukedom,
was just inside the door.</p>

<p>“Quick, that’s my real partner. He’ll grab me.”</p>

<p>“He won’t,” said Gilbert firmly. He caught her to
him a little fiercely, with all the primitive man in him
awake. His mother’s warning about the bad stock from
which Claudia sprang was forgotten. He had decided
that Claudia was his. <em>He</em>, and he only, was going to
grab her and carry her off to his Wigwam. <em>His</em>
wife would never want to be a Circe. Geoffrey Iverson
had never been worth much as a husband. Like most
men, Gilbert had his fair share of conceit.</p>

<p>He guided her skilfully round the room, interposing
himself and his arm between her and possible collisions,
for the room was inconveniently crowded. She happily
forgot the rest of the world and gave herself up to the
sensuous music. But some of the gay spirit with which
she had danced earlier in the evening had gone from her,
a slight languor, more than a little pleasant, had stolen
into her veins. The music seemed a lullaby to send her
brain to sleep. She liked to feel the pressure of Gilbert’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
arm and know that it enclosed her safely. She had
danced with him before on one or two other occasions;
but to-night his arm seemed to caress her. There was
a curious charm in it and she abandoned herself to it.
She had never before danced with anyone who had given
her this sensation.</p>

<p>And Gilbert felt the blood rushing through his veins
as he would have thought impossible an hour ago. The
knowledge of her liking, her nearness to him, seemed to
make a little hammer pound away in his head, so that he
had to set his teeth not to let himself get giddy. And
Gilbert, when roused, had a good deal of the masculine
animal in him, only he was so seldom roused. When he
was a youth at Oxford his very clear and reasonable
brain had warned him of a possible danger to his working
powers in the delights of the flesh, and he had made himself
not think about them by grinding away at his books.
His work and his intellect had become an almost invulnerable
armour. But to-night passion took him by the
throat and he could think of nothing but the lissome
pretty body in his arms. And his intellect, not quite
drugged, approved of this diversion. His mother had
said it was time to marry. Why not combine pleasure
and duty? His reason quite approved of this proceeding.</p>

<p>“Claudia,” he said breathlessly, coming to a standstill,
“it’s confoundedly hot in here. Don’t you feel it. Shall
we—shall we try for some fresh air?”</p>

<p>She nodded, she did not want to speak. A beautiful
dream had been roughly broken into. She had been
happy in her unsubstantial dream; he—had not.</p>

<p>Gilbert was lucky enough to find an untenanted cosy
corner in a convenient angle that cut them off from the
rest of the world.</p>

<p>“Claudia, will you?” His arm was round the back
of the couch ready to take her in his arms.</p>

<p>“Will I—what?” faltered the girl. She knew what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
would ask, but she had not imagined being proposed to
thus. She had thought the man she could love would
lead up gradually with protestations, with promises, with
entreaties. Why did there seem no time for this? Why
did something hurry her into his arms, something irresistibly
compelling, stronger than herself?</p>

<p>“Will you marry me?” She tried to raise her eyes to
his, and perhaps he caught a glimpse of what was in
them for the next instant she felt his lips on hers, and
the world rocked and then stood still.</p>

<p class="tb">Afterwards, she wished that it had been more as her
imagination had planned. Though every pulse in her
body still throbbed with his kisses, she yet vaguely regretted
that Prince Charming had not come in the guise
she had imagined. But that it was the real Prince
Charming—in somewhat of a hurry and a little inarticulate—she
did not doubt for a moment.</p>

<p>“But nothing is just as one imagines it will be,” said
Claudia to herself and the pillow that night. And having
discovered that truth, Nature kindly pulled down the
blinds and she went to sleep.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="I_CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">A TOY MOTHER</span></h3>

<p>Later the same day Claudia awakened to the sound
of snortings and snufflings. Exasperated puffings
sounded in her ear. For an instant she dreamed that she
was being pursued down a long road by an angry motor-car
bent on her destruction. It came nearer and nearer—now
it was quite close—she put out her hand in vague
dreamlike fashion to push it away. The motor-car retreated
somewhere at her touch, but returned in a few
seconds to make a fresh onslaught. Then something
soft and velvety—obviously not a motor-car—rubbed up
against her cheek. Claudia came back from the world
of Nowhere in Particular to her own room in Grosvenor
Square.</p>

<p>To whom could those snortings and snufflings belong
save Billie, her beloved dachshund!</p>

<p>Claudia yawned lazily. Billie gave another tug to the
brown plait on her pillow. That was always Billie’s way
of engaging her attention in the morning. Extraordinary,
how long these superior mortals took to awake in the
morning when they were always so bright and fond of
pulling his ears at night!</p>

<p>The outline of the map of the world was still blurred
for his mistress when she vaguely remembered that
something very pleasant had happened to her. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
was it that made her open her eyes that sense of
<i lang="fr">bien être</i>?</p>

<p>“Oh!... Oh! Billie!” She turned on her elbow and
kissed Billie’s silky brown coat with unusual fervour.
He was the most delightful thing in dachshunds, with a
coat like sealskin, only softer and warmer, and the most
pathetic and companionable eyes in the world. He was
exclusively devoted to Claudia, who, in return, gave him
a big corner of her heart. To the rest of the family he
was a little elusive and aloof, rather bored with their
desultory attentions, occasionally very busy with his own
thoughts and affairs. Only Claudia’s hand gave him
real joy. Sometimes out of politeness he allowed Pat
to think he liked her petting, but that was because she
was only a young thing and Claudia was fond of her.</p>

<p>“Billie,” she said, with a rippling laugh of sheer happiness,
“you don’t know it, but I’m different from what I
was yesterday morning. I’m engaged!”</p>

<p>Billie regarded her seriously. He seemed to be digesting
the news and wondering what difference it would
make to him.</p>

<p>“Yes,” continued his mistress, giving him a hug. “I’m
engaged. I’ve promised to marry someone very, very
nice. Congratulate me, Billie.”</p>

<p>Billie rose to the situation and barked joyously.</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir. I am sure they were most sincere
congratulations. Heigh ho! we shall have to tell mother....
What do you say to breakfast, eh?”</p>

<p>She put her hand on the bell, and Billie blinked happily.
He always waited to take his breakfast with Claudia,
and really she was very late during the season.</p>

<p>“Billie, don’t rootle about in the bed like that. Be more
respectful, because I’m much more important to-day than
I was yesterday.” Then she lay back among the pillows
and thought happily of Gilbert. She longed to see him
or hear from him. She hoped he would telephone or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
perhaps send her some flowers on his way to his chambers.
She was certain he must be thinking of her just
as she was thinking of him.</p>

<p>She had a curious and not unpleasant feeling that last
night she had settled her whole life. She was like someone
who had been standing at the cross-roads awaiting an
indication which turning to take. Last night she had
taken what she was sure was the right turning. Now the
road of her life seemed to stretch before her like a
glorious golden riband.</p>

<p>Yet, oddly enough, at the back of her mind was a
sense of loss. She had lost the right of making her
choice, she had lost a certain excited feeling that life was
a great adventure. The adventure had taken definite
shape now like a fluid that has been poured into a mould.
Some of the delightful indecision, one of the biggest
“perhapses” of life had gone. She had always taken it for
granted that she would marry without making it her
business to do so. She had looked with soft, speculative
eyes at the men she met. Perhaps it will be this one—perhaps
I shall sit next to him at dinner to-night—perhaps
he will be one of my partners at the dance to-morrow!
A girl who knows that she is attractive to
men always has this feeling consciously or unconsciously.
Now this feeling had merged into something else, the
happy glow of knowledge. Love had come.</p>

<p>It seemed to Claudia that it had come rather suddenly,
although she had known Gilbert for many years. It
was only the last month he had seemed a “possible.”
She remembered the exact moment that the label had
fixed itself upon him. She had been at a big dinner-party,
given by the wife of the Home Secretary, and the
man who took her in had talked all through the fish
and the entrée about him. That was before the Driver
case, when he had definitely proved his metal, but her
dinner companion had been brought into contact with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
him over some business and been greatly impressed with
his ability. Claudia had heard vaguely of Gilbert’s distinguished
career at Oxford, but the thumb-nail sketch
which her companion drew of him in his chambers arrested
her attention. Then later that very evening she
had met him at a reception which her aunt, Lady Pitsea,
gave.</p>

<p>Claudia had an almost Greek appreciation and love for
physical fitness, and had Gilbert not been a most personable
man, her interest in his mental achievements might
have evaporated. But because he was strong and came
of healthy stock, the night-oil that he had burned had
so far left no mark upon him. There was no doubt that
he had personality, that he would never be overlooked
wherever he went. Claudia could never have married a
handsome man without brains, but it is doubtful if she
could have loved anything lacking in physical fitness.
She demanded a certain amount of beauty and colour in
her life, just as she demanded a certain amount of fresh
air and food.</p>

<p>Until the reception they had not met for a couple of
years, and he showed unmistakably that he admired her.
After that he seemed to dwarf the other men with whom
she ate and danced and talked. That she did not meet
him often at social gatherings—he was too busy to go—whetted
her appetite for his company. Sometimes he
would come in to some gathering with a little line of
fatigue between his brows. It had been an agreeable
pastime to smooth it out by her conversation and gaiety.</p>

<p>She realized this morning, as she stirred her coffee,
that actually they had talked very little. Not that he
was a silent companion, but they had always talked in
crowded places of other people and current events.
Necessarily their talk had been largely on the surface—a
large surface, but yet only the surface of the things
that matter. She had never, since childhood’s days, been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
with him for many consecutive hours. She had never,
since those days, been alone with him in the country,
tramping side by side, or sitting for long, lazy hours
under the green trees. Claudia knew that such times
bare the man or woman of mannerisms and conventionalities,
and expose the real ego. Two or three times
before she had thought she liked men, but always on
further and closer knowledge she had found them disappointing.
Then she had been annoyed with herself for
even that faint stirring of interest. In some unaccountable
way she had felt humiliated when her brain failed to
approve of them. But Gilbert could not disappoint her.
How could such an admittedly clever man disappoint any
woman? She was glad he was going to have a career,
she saw herself helping him, entering into his thoughts
and aims, working and loving side by side. She was
glad she had not fallen in love with a nonentity or an
idle, rich man.</p>

<p>She reflected that she would have hated to feel apologetic
for her husband. And yet she had seen girls of
her own age, whom she knew to be clever and even brilliant,
marry men, and not for money or position, who
seemed to be absolutely devoid of the grey matter we call
brain. She had heard them rave rapturously over commonplace
males that bored her in twenty minutes, and
she knew that Love is a freakish thing. Fate might have
played a joke on her. “I wonder what it is exactly—this
sex attraction?” she murmured to the sleeping dachshund,
and pigeonholed the question for future investigation,
when her mind was quite clear and at rest, for
Gilbert had urged a speedy marriage.</p>

<p>Gilbert’s love-making had been almost inarticulate.
She wished he had said something memorable, something
she could enshrine in her heart and when she was an
old woman bring forth with a happy smile—“Do you
remember you said——” But Gilbert had hardly even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
said the conventional <i lang="de">Ich liebe dich</i>. Ah! but his heart,
beating violently against her own, had said it. Claudia
did not know that in the crucial moment love and passion
are indistinguishable, so she had no doubt that his soul
had spoken to hers.</p>

<p>Billie raised his head from the eiderdown and looked
questioningly at the door. Someone was approaching.
A rap with something sharp and hard followed.</p>

<p>“Can I come in, Claudia? Johnson said you were
having your breakfast.”</p>

<p>Claudia called out permission to enter, and a fair young
Amazon, riding-crop in hand, stalked into the room. It
was Patricia Iverson, generally called Pat, the youngest
of the three children of Circe. Pat was unusually tall,
and in her long riding-habit she looked even taller than
usual. She was flushed with exertion, her fine, fair skin
showed almost startlingly against the black of her hat
and habit.</p>

<p>“Bill, where are your manners? Why don’t you wag
your tail? All right, I shall wag it for you! What’s
the good of being a dog with a usable tail, if you don’t
wave it when a lady enters the room? Oh! it was
spiffing in the Park this morning.”</p>

<p>“I am sure it was. I feel ashamed to be in bed, but I
was so late again this morning. Past four. Aren’t we
fools to dance the night away and spend the mornings
in bed?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Patricia, disposing her long limbs in an
easy chair. “But I shall do it when I get the chance.”</p>

<p>“You ache to be dissipated?”</p>

<p>“Rather, because after dissipation you can appreciate
virtue and—a rest. Claudia, why are you smiling like a
Cheshire cat this morning? I hate people to smile like
that unless they tell me the reason. It’s like hearing
the music of a dance you can’t go to.”</p>

<p>Claudia wondered if she would break the news to Pat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
It was strange, but there was nobody to whom she felt
<em>compelled</em> to impart her news. There was no one would
quite understand and be glad with her in her gladness.
Pat was so young, and then you never knew how she
would take things. Sometimes she was as hard as nails,
and Claudia naturally felt she would like a sympathetic ear.</p>

<p>“I’ve been riding with Mr. Paton,” continued Patricia,
pulling Billie’s ear, a proceeding which he bore with the
patience of an early Christian martyr. “We had such a
jolly gallop. He’s awfully nice, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Very nice,” agreed Claudia heartily. She felt that
the whole world of men and women were nice this morning,
but she could honestly give Paton an emphatic adjective.
“He’s a great friend of—of Gilbert Currey’s.”</p>

<p>“He says such quaint things sometimes, and he isn’t
a bit like most men you meet. Do you know what we
were talking about this morning? We were discussing
animals, and how far they feel human emotion, and how
much brain they’ve got. He’d been reading some German
book on the subject. He’s fond of animals. Oh!
he sent you a message.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” Claudia was wondering what the bond of
sympathy was between the two men.</p>

<p>“He told me to tell you that he’s ordered that book
you wanted from the publisher. And I am to convey
an invitation for us both to have tea with him to-day in
Kensington Gardens. We don’t need Jujubes.”</p>

<p>Jujubes was a disrespectful name applied to Miss
Morrow who had once been with them as governess, and
had slid into position of amiable General Utility. She
could be used as a chaperon, walking-stick, or sedative.
Hence Pat’s nickname for her.</p>

<p>“I promised to go to some theatricals at Stretton
House,” said Claudia, grabbing her diary, “and, let me
see—yes, I ought to go with Aunt Carrie to call on some
people.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>But her words were regretful. She would have loved
to sit in the Park and have tea under the trees, where
the birds come hopping round your chairs for crumbs,
and everything around is green and fragrant. It would
have accorded so much better with her mood than paying
formal calls on people to whom she couldn’t tell the
great and important thing that had happened to her.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a pig, Claudia. I’m not allowed to do much,
and you might say yes. Mr. Paton won’t want me without
you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he would. Take Jujubes.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! he looks upon me as a flapper. Wait till
mother gives me some proper dresses and I begin to fill
out. I look like the Bones of the Holy Innocents now,
but you wait till I get some curves. They are beginning
to come.”</p>

<p>She nodded her head knowingly, as she looked down
at herself.</p>

<p>Claudia suddenly decided she would throw over Aunt
Carrie. This was a special day in her life, and she felt
she ought to do just what she wanted most. If only
Gilbert could tea with them! She thought of telephoning,
and then some instinct warned her that Gilbert would
think it trivial. Gilbert not being available, Claudia
found the idea of a quiet sunny afternoon with Colin
Paton quite pleasing. One never had to be politely talkative
and interested in him. One talked or one didn’t
talk, just as one pleased. Sometimes one found oneself
talking particularly well, helped by the right word or the
appreciative smile. Claudia thought of him in a sort of
revolving roundabout with Gilbert, as she took her bath,
and tried to find the right word to express him. The
best she could get was “companionable,” although she
felt that was a little tepid.</p>

<p>When she was dressed she sent a message to her
mother. She must tell her the news. Sometimes Claudia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
did not see her for days together, and they were in no
sense mother and daughter, but Claudia felt it was the
proper thing to inform her at once. It had always
seemed to her friends that Mrs. Iverson was a mother
merely for the three weeks she had to remain an invalid.
After that she shook off her maternity.</p>

<p>The maid came back with the answer that Mrs. Iverson
was having her face massaged, but that Claudia could
come to her.</p>

<p>Her mother’s bedroom and dressing-room suggested
a hothouse with a quantity of mirrors. Circe had always
been something of an exotic, and lately she had grown
more so, or what Pat called “stuffier.” There was an
insidious Eastern perfume that always trailed after Sybil
Iverson, and the room Claudia entered was heavy with
it. The hangings and huge divan were Oriental in colouring
and material. The sun was excluded from the room
by pink curtains closely shrouding the windows, and
electric lamps with becoming shades were burning. Her
mother was in the dressing-room, prostrate under the
hands of the masseur, who had a great reputation among
women, especially those who were on the borderland of
youth and middle age. He was ridiculously expensive,
but his hands were magical.</p>

<p>Mrs. Iverson lazily opened her closed eyelids and regarded
Claudia. Her eyes were still very beautiful.
“You wanted to see me dear?”</p>

<p>Claudia hesitated. “Yes, but——” If it had been
Pat she would have said cryptically “P and P”—private
and particular.</p>

<p>“Well, Jules has nearly finished.” Mrs. Iverson was
still beautiful, but with a great effort. In her youth
when the famous portrait had been painted, she had been
almost as fair as Patricia, but now her hair was tinted
auburn and her complexion was enamelled to match.
Her eyes—still marvellous—were of a deep shade of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
blue, like a violet under the rays of the midday sun. Her
mouth was much fuller than Patricia’s; and told its own
tale. Mrs. Iverson had always been unutterably bored
with her children, but she seemed to like or rather dislike
Claudia the least. Patricia annoyed her, because she
was reminded of her own lost freshness, and Jack she
found stupid. She really rather liked to talk to Claudia
for a quarter of an hour or so. Claudia was neither
<i lang="fr">gauche</i> nor ignorant. And her brown eyes, with their
purposeful gaze—well, some memories are pleasanter
than others, even to a Circe.</p>

<p>Claudia picked up the <cite>Occult Review</cite>, and tried to be
interested in it till her mother should be free.</p>

<p>At length Jules departed. Mrs. Iverson inspected the
result in the hand-mirror.</p>

<p>“He’s a marvel. I hope he’ll still be alive when you
want him.... I like the cut of your skirt, Claudia. Who
made it? Ah! I thought so. She can cut skirts. Don’t
you find her ruinous?”</p>

<p>It was a polite interrogation, as though to a stranger.</p>

<p>“Yes, I thought her more of a robber than usual,”
continued her mother. “I’m glad you haven’t got such
long legs as Patricia. When she comes toward me with
her arm waving she reminds me of a sign-post on a
country road. It’s a pity. Men don’t like too long
women. You and I are just the right height. I think
this modern girl by the yard is a mistake. None of the
famous women such as Jeanne du Barry and Ninon de
Lenclos were very tall. Patricia will make most men
look ridiculous.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Pat doesn’t want to be a Ninon de Lenclos,”
suggested Claudia, with a twinkle.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, every woman wants to be a Ninon de
Lenclos, if she could have the chance. Don’t be taken
in by this talk of ‘I wouldn’t.’ It’s a case of ‘I couldn’t.’
Most women have to be virtuous, because they can’t be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
anything else, and they make the best of it. What’s that
American saying, ‘Virtue must be its own reward—any
other would be a tip.’ Do you know what Ninon said
herself, ‘Love is a passion, not a virtue: and a passion
does not turn into a virtue because it happens to last—it
merely becomes a longer passion.’ ... But what did
you want to see me about?”</p>

<p>It should have been a propitious opening, this discussion
of love, but somehow it was not.</p>

<p>“I think—I think I ought to tell you something.”</p>

<p>“Don’t unless you want to,” said her mother quickly.
“I don’t think you <em>ought</em> to tell me anything. If you
think it will interest me—tell me, but don’t use me as
a mother, please.”</p>

<p>“Would it interest you to know that I am engaged?”
It was out. Claudia breathed more freely. Then she
blushed as her mother looked at her with unusual attention.</p>

<p>“Yes, that quite interests me. I have wondered once or
twice what sort of a man you would choose. Who is it?”</p>

<p>“Gilbert Currey, mother.”</p>

<p>“Gilbert C——yes, the M.P.’s son. Does something,
doesn’t he? A barrister? I remember his mother
Marian Darby. She never liked me, and I returned the
compliment; but we were once great friends. What
made you choose her son?”</p>

<p>“Mother! I—I fell in love with him. Why do people
marry?”</p>

<p>Circe smiled at her young daughter, who met her eyes
quite squarely but was obviously uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“For hundreds of reasons, my dear. You’ll find out
some of them later on. Of course, one must marry”—she
retouched an eyebrow with a little brush—“just as
one must have a birth certificate and a license for the
motor.... I don’t think I’ve noticed him since he was
a boy. I remember him at Wynnstay. I used to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
him in a canoe on the river, deep in his books. Is he
still strenuous and booky?”</p>

<p>“People say he is going to have a big career.” It was
difficult to talk to her mother.</p>

<p>“Really? And you want to be part of that career?
Well, I daresay it is all right. Better tell your father.
I should think you might have done better from a worldly
point of view, though the Curreys are rich, and Gilbert
will succeed to the baronetcy.... You’ve really made
up your mind? Your aunt was telling me the other day
that you are considered one of the most attractive girls
in Society to-day. She mentioned a Russian prince of
great renown—I forget his name——”</p>

<p>“He is fifty and has been married twice already.”</p>

<p>“Men grow more appreciative, not less so, as they
get older. And Russians are sometimes fascinating. I
remember one—Russians can be very wild and romantic.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want a wild and romantic husband.” Claudia
laughed outright.</p>

<p>“No?—perhaps you are right. There is plenty of
time, and I daresay a Russian would not make a comfortable
husband. Well, child, I am glad if you are
glad. I must meet my future son-in-law.” She made
a little grimace. “It adds at least five years to my age,
but I suppose I can’t ask you to consider me. I think
he had better come to dinner one night. Look in my
engagement book and find a night. Thursday—yes, that
will do. Write down your name and Gilbert’s, and then
I shall remember all about it. One or two of the family
might be asked.” She gave her daughter a smile of
dismissal. It was very sweet, if a trifle automatic, and
it showed to advantage her perfect and natural teeth.
Mrs. Iverson never kissed her children, but then she
thought kissing between women ridiculous. The only
thing she ever kissed of the female sex was a little toy
terrier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>When Claudia went downstairs, relieved that the news
had been broken, she found the book had arrived that
Colin Paton had promised to obtain for her. She cut
the string and dipped into it. It was a volume of essays
that he had mentioned to her and that she had expressed
a desire to read. Colin Paton never forgot things.</p>

<p>She looked from the book to the telephone and wished
that Gilbert had found time to ring her up and just say,
“Hallo! Here am I and there are you!” It would have
seemed to make last night more real, more sure. Like a
puff of wind it crossed her mind that the sender of the
book would have somehow got in touch with the woman
he had asked to be his wife the night before. Pat liked
him. Perhaps he would marry Pat, she thought idly.</p>

<p>She was too keenly, too tinglingly alive for delicate
essays that morning. Later on she would enjoy them.
She put them down and picked up an illustrated paper.</p>

<p>The first thing that met her gaze was a portrait of
Gilbert and a paragraph recording his right to such a
distinction.</p>

<p>There was no one in the library, and she raised it impulsively
to her lips. It was not a satisfactory kiss, for
the paper smelt of something nasty and oily. Still the
portrait seemed to bring Gilbert into the room with her.
And this man was hers, this man at whom all the Bar
was looking, was hers, hers, hers!</p>

<p>Because she was only twenty-one, thoroughly healthy
and full of life, she danced round the room holding the
paper to her breast. Her eyes were alight with happiness;
her soft lips were curved with the joy of love and
life.</p>

<p>Then having danced her little Te Deum to the music
of her heart, she waltzed out of the door with a cheery
shout for Billie. She would take him for a walk and
give him joy, too.</p>

<h3 id="I_CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">GREEN BAY-LEAVES</span></h3>

<p>Lady Currey was not at all pleased with her son’s
engagement, and she said so. She came to town
for this purpose, and made Gilbert give her lunch while
she strongly disapproved, from the <i lang="fr">hors d’œuvres</i> to the
coffee. She had the soulless good looks which Time, as
if contemptuous, neglects to touch. And because she
could afford to do so, she purposely dressed in a middle-aged,
sober fashion which she considered dignified. She
had a great sense of her own importance, and the modern
grandmother of fifty in ninon and picture-hats was to
her extreme anathema. She and Circe were much the
same age. Sybil Daunton-Pole had flashed into society
like a brilliant comet, a trail of admirers behind her,
when Gilbert’s mother, the amiable daughter of the then
Home Secretary, had been one of the small and unremarked
stars that dot the social firmament.</p>

<p>Lady Currey had brought her husband a considerable
sum of money, but the only thing for which she needed
money was to gratify her craze for old china. If she
had any heart or soul it was given to her specimens of
priceless Ming and old Chelsea. She spent hours every
day dusting her cabinets. Her only idea of travel was
the opportunity it gave her for visiting museums and
picking up bargains in rare porcelain.</p>

<p>For Gilbert she had a pleasant feeling of proprietorship—much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the same as she felt for the wonderful
<i lang="fr">famille rose</i>-jar of the Kien-Lung period which she had
herself unearthed in a visit to the East. Gilbert was an
only child, and he had been little or no trouble. This
was the first time he had disappointed her. When other
mothers complained of their sons, of escapades at Eton
and Oxford, or premature and undesirable love affairs,
of monumental debts and lack of family pride, Lady
Currey’s lips always took on an added shade of complacency
as she thought of Gilbert and the even and admirable
tenour of his way. It was entirely becoming that
Gilbert should be so satisfactory and in some way reflected
well on herself, just as did the discovery of the
<i lang="fr">famille rose</i>-jar. Lady Currey liked everything around
her to be <i lang="fr">comme il faut</i>, not the elastic <i lang="fr">comme il faut</i>
of fashion, but rather the correctness of the copybook
and the ten commandments. Curiously enough, engrossed
in herself and her china, she had never until
quite recently speculated, as do most mothers, on her
son’s probable choice of a wife. When she had thought
of it, she had dismissed the idea with the assurance that
Gilbert would choose wisely and soberly and to his advantage.
It was not in her to feel any jealousy of the
woman Gilbert should love.</p>

<p>“I am grieved,” she said, sitting very upright—she
rarely used the back of a chair—“I am grieved to think
that you intend to marry into the Iverson family. The
Iversons are not a family of which I—or any right-thinking
people—approve.”</p>

<p>“But, mother,” said Gilbert, rather taken aback, for
he had become used to her invariable approval, “I am
not marrying the family. I am marrying Claudia.”</p>

<p>“Ah! that’s what you think—the usual reply. For
Geoffrey Iverson I have no particular dislike—he has
been the cat’s-paw of a clever and unscrupulous woman.
His family is a very good one. She would have spoilt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
any man who had the misfortune to be married to her.
Why, Sybil Iverson is notorious!”</p>

<p>“Claudia is quite unlike her in every way. Why, she
is not even like her in appearance.”</p>

<p>Lady Currey lifted her thin, fair eyebrows. It was
unbecoming that she should tell him the scandalous
rumours that floated about respecting Claudia’s parentage:
Such things could only be told by a father to a son.
She vehemently disapproved of any plain speaking
between the sexes. Such a crime could never be laid to
her charge; not even in the marital chamber had she
ever discussed any such thing.</p>

<p>“She is the daughter of her mother, Gilbert, and the
mother—I say it deliberately—is a bad woman, a woman
who has trailed the glory and purity of the flower of
womanhood in the dust.” Lady Currey occasionally indulged
in such flights of rhetoric. She had rehearsed
this in the train.</p>

<p>“I don’t think the two women see much of one another.”
Gilbert was a little nettled. “Claudia told me
herself that she hardly knew her mother at all in her
young days. She was left entirely to her governesses.
She can hardly have imbibed any—any idea from her
mother.”</p>

<p>The pathos of such an admission did not strike Lady
Currey, it only helped to justify her present attitude.</p>

<p>“It is, of course, very painful for me to have to mention
such matters to you, but why has she seen so little
of her mother? Because Sybil was—I blush to say it—so
surrounded by lovers that she neglected her maternal
duties. I say again, she is notorious for her lax life
and morals. Don’t you believe in heredity, Gilbert?
Think of the blood that runs in that girl’s veins.”</p>

<p>Gilbert frowned. “Heredity is a curious thing. Not
worth worrying over, I think. I don’t profess to understand
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have studied the question.” She had read one
book that was quite out of date. “I firmly believe in
heredity. The vices or the virtues of the father and
mother are surely transmitted to the children.” It was
pleasing to think that only virtues could be transmitted
to Gilbert, but it was all the more annoying that those
inherited virtues should be linked with the vices of Sybil
Iverson’s child.</p>

<p>Gilbert was becoming annoyed, and made no reply.
After all, his mother was only a woman, and women
never could argue. It jarred on his manhood that she
should take him to task, and his voice was a little cold
as he inquired what she would take to drink.</p>

<p>“You know I always take <em>one</em> glass of claret.” The
tone somehow implied that a woman like Sybil Iverson
might reprehensibly vary her drink with lunch, but she
had regular habits. Then she returned to the attack.</p>

<p>“Claudia is not the woman that we—your dear father
and I—would have chosen for you.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t every mother say that about her son’s
choice?”</p>

<p>His mother sighed and waited while Gilbert ordered
the wine. “What sort of bringing-up has she had? What
sort of a wife and mother will such a girl make? Her
mother’s only god was pleasure, her only commandment
‘Enjoy the fleeting hour.’ Do you mean to tell me that
the daughter of such a woman has proper ideas about
life? Would you care to be the complaisant husband of
a Circe?”</p>

<p>But here Gilbert put his foot down. His mother
must be made to see that he knew quite well what he
was about, that he had not run haphazard into this engagement.
Not on any account would he let her see
that curious mixture of surprise and annoyance at the
back of his mind when he thought of the proposal scene.
He had an undefined feeling that he had been hurried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
into it, though how he had been hurried, by whom or
by what, he did not seek to explain even to himself. To
Gilbert’s cast of mind vague feelings were best ignored
as symptoms of a weak and illogical brain, much the
same as vague symptoms may denote an illness of the
body. Still the feeling was there, behind many stacks
of docketed and pigeonholed pieces of information. Yet
he had almost made up his mind to propose to Claudia—oh!
yes—only—that particular night?</p>

<p>“Mother, I cannot hear you say such ridiculous things
about Claudia. You do not know her. You might as
well say that the children of murderers will all grow up
murderers.”</p>

<p>“You might commit murder in a sudden fit of passion,
but such a warped, degraded nature as Sybil Iverson’s
is another story. Besides—the sons of a murderer have
probably seen him hanged or punished—the law steps in;
but who punishes a woman like Sybil Iverson? Society,
nowadays, is too lax to such creatures, and virtuous
women have to mix with them and take them by the
hand, or else be dubbed ridiculous or old-fashioned. Well,”
with a sudden little gust of passion like a disturbance in a
tea-cup, “thank God, I am old-fashioned and absurd. I
can say my prayers every night and lie down in peace....
No, Gilbert, you know I only take <em>one</em> glass of claret.”</p>

<p>“They say Mrs. Iverson has given up her wicked,
siren-like ways and gone in for spiritualism.” He wished
his mother realized that she was keeping him from his
work and would hurry up with her lunch. The leisurely
ways of the country were not those of town. But Lady
Currey was doing her duty.</p>

<p>“Such women never give up their wicked ways, they
take them to the grave with them.” Both Gilbert and
his mother had very little sense of humour, with the distinction
that Gilbert knew when things were ridiculous.
“I know Sybil’s mother died of a broken heart.” This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
was quite untrue, she had died of fatty degeneration of
the liver. “But there, the Psalms say that the wicked
flourish like green bay-trees, and if they did in King
David’s time there is no doubt they do now. But their
punishment awaits them, Gilbert; always remember
that.”</p>

<p>Gilbert nodded absently. Life after death was one
of the vague things, like psychology, that he did not
consider as practical politics. But he did not tell his
mother this. If she liked to imagine him striving for a
golden harp with humility of soul, she might.</p>

<p>“I confess I am disappointed in you, Gilbert. I had
looked forward to your choosing some nice girl I could
take to my heart, someone like Maud Curtice, for example.”</p>

<p>Maud Curtice was a colourless girl who agreed with
Lady Currey in being shocked at the modern scanty
fashion of dressing—she was painfully thin and had
ungainly hands and feet—and who devoted herself to the
mothers of eligible sons. She also had a large income.</p>

<p>“Wait till you know Claudia, mother. You are sure
to like her.”</p>

<p>“I have heard she is very handsome and a great
favourite in Society,” returned his mother gloomily. “It
is a bad report to my way of thinking. That’s how
her mother started.”</p>

<p>Just then, to his great relief, Gilbert caught sight of
Colin Paton wending his way out of the restaurant. He
hailed him with joy, and Paton came to a standstill beside
their table.</p>

<p>Lady Currey approved of Colin Paton. His manners
were respectful and he showed an intelligent interest in
china. She never noticed the quizzical gravity with
which he received her views on life, nor the humorous
twinkle in his eyes at her criticisms. She thought him
“a very nice young man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>“Colin, old man, come and have some coffee with us.”</p>

<p>“Just had some. I hope you are quite well, Lady
Currey?”</p>

<p>Gilbert made a business of looking at his watch and
starting with alarm. “By jove, I didn’t know it was so
late. I must just swallow my coffee and run. May I
leave the mater with you to finish her coffee at her
leisure?”</p>

<p>Colin caught the appeal in Gilbert’s eyes and guessed
the cause.</p>

<p>“Certainly, if Lady Currey will accept me as a poor
substitute for you.”</p>

<p>Lady Currey smiled a gracious assent. “I hope your
dear mother is better, Mr. Paton?”</p>

<p>“Yes, thank you.... Busy as usual, Gilbert? I hear
the proverbial busy bee is quite out of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am tearingly busy. Don’t get a minute to
myself.”</p>

<p>Paton slipped into his chair. “And yet you’ve found
time to get engaged, I hear? I wrote my congratulation
this morning.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, old chap. Oh! getting engaged doesn’t take
very long.” Gilbert laughed pleasantly and displayed
his firm white teeth.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it?” returned Paton, smiling. “I think it
would take me no end of a time. But there, we shall
soon be born in the morning, married at midday, and
buried in the evening!” He saw Lady Currey looking
at him rather doubtfully. “A man like your son, Lady
Currey, takes a woman and the world by storm. <i lang="la">Veni,
vidi, vici</i> is not for me. Women have to know me quite
a long time before they remember me.”</p>

<p>“I am sure you have a great many friends,” she said
encouragingly.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s why I expect I shall never get a wife....
Really must go, Gilbert? I had tea with Claudia and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the long-legged Patricia yesterday. We wished you
could have been with us.”</p>

<p>“Teas are not in my line. I suppose I shall see you
again soon?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going away, you know.”</p>

<p>Gilbert turned back in surprise.</p>

<p>“What, at the beginning of the season!” exclaimed
Lady Currey.</p>

<p>“Going out to the Argentine for a while. A friend
of mine is going out on a political mission and wants an
assistant. I’ve decided to accompany him. Never been
there, and it must be an interesting country.”</p>

<p>Gilbert raised his eyebrows. Why on earth didn’t
Paton stop in one place and make a name for himself?
He had often advised him to do so.</p>

<p>“Sudden isn’t it? I thought you said the other night
that you were remaining in town until the end of July.”</p>

<p>Paton nodded. “I’ve changed my mind. I think I
want a change. I shall only be away six months or so,
perhaps a year.”</p>

<p>Gilbert’s thoughts had raced ahead. “Then if we’re
married at the end of July, as is probable, you’ll be
away? That’s too bad. I had relied on you for being
best man.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be married so soon? No, I am afraid I can’t
assist to give you away.”</p>

<p>Gilbert again expressed his regrets, which were quite
genuine, and left his mother with Paton. Colin did not
make the mistake of rushing in where angels fear to
tread, but waited for Lady Currey’s comments.</p>

<p>“What do you think of this engagement, Mr. Paton?
I know I can speak to you quite frankly. I think it is a
great mistake. Weren’t you surprised?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned Paton truthfully, “I was very surprised.
Gilbert did not confide his hopes in me. I didn’t
see any wooing going on, and he never talked about her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
to me. He must have made the running quickly.” Then
he added, half to himself, “He can’t have seen a great
deal of her.”</p>

<p>“Of course not, or he wouldn’t have done it. Gilbert,
for once in his life, has lost his head over a pretty
woman. Why, you are much more of a friend than
Gilbert.”</p>

<p>A slight shadow crossed her companion’s face and he
dropped his eyelids. “Well, I thought I was. But then
friend—oh! it’s the <i lang="la">veni, vidi, vici</i> trick. She’s a charming
girl, Lady Currey, with all sorts of possibilities.”</p>

<p>Lady Currey pursed up her thin lips that had never
bestowed or received a kiss of passion. “She is handsome,
certainly. But is she the wife for Gilbert? I
have lived long enough to know that looks are a poor
foundation for matrimony.”</p>

<p>“She has quite a good deal of character,” said her
companion quietly, without any annoying enthusiasm.
“I am sure she will develop into a splendid woman with
the man she loves. She isn’t the usual pretty society
doll, you know.”</p>

<p>“Does it strike you that Gilbert wants a woman of
character?” asked his mother with unexpected acuteness.
“Clever men are usually better mated to stupid wives.
Look at Carlyle and Jane Welsh! Much too clever for
one another.” Then irrelevantly, “There are too many
clever girls nowadays. I don’t believe they make any
the better wives and mothers for being so clever. I am
sure I never wanted such a daughter-in-law.”</p>

<p>Paton found himself at a loss for conversation. He knew
he could do Claudia no good by praising her warmly
to her future mother-in-law, he might even make
matters worse. Yet to hear Claudia belittled made something
leap within him into fierce flame. It seemed disloyal
to listen to Lady Currey’s sneers. Yet he knew
that Claudia must storm the citadel of Lady Currey’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
heart herself. As an advance agent his labours would
be wasted. But Paton, looking across the table into the
light, offended eyes of the woman, was sorry for the
girl. It was rather odd. His mother, a confirmed invalid,
and Lady Currey had been close friends in their
youth. Yet his mother had warmly liked Claudia when
she had once met her for a few minutes. He was
startled to find that his current of thought had communicated
itself to Lady Currey.</p>

<p>“Your mother always did like pretty things—I know
she admires Claudia—but she was always unduly swayed
by good looks, even at school. I know how deceptive
they are. A man told me the other day that his wife
had left him and been through the Divorce Court, and
he attributed it entirely to her good looks. ‘A very pretty
woman is difficult to live with,’ he said; ‘she gets a great
deal of adulation and flattery in Society, and naturally
the husband at home falls rather flat.’ There is a lot of
truth in that, Mr. Paton.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he was the typical English husband who, as
soon as he has won a wife, forgets to be her lover,” replied
Paton. “You are very careful and precious of
your rare china, Lady Currey.”</p>

<p>His <i lang="fr">vis-à-vis</i> stared. She wondered that Paton, who
was usually so smooth in conversation, should make such
a sudden jump. But it served to divert her mind from
Claudia.</p>

<p>“I had such luck last week. I was walking along the
High Street in Moulton and I caught sight of a pair of
vases. I thought that powder blue could be nothing less
than Chinese. They had blue and white reserves on
them. <em>You</em> know what that means. I got them for a
mere song, and they’re beauties. Since I last saw you
I have bought....”</p>

<p>Still talking china, Paton saw her into a taxi.</p>

<p>He strolled away from the restaurant. It was warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and sunny, and the pedestrians seemed all in a good
humour. Paton often wandered for hours through the
streets of London, finding in that wonderful panorama
food for eyes and brain and heart. He loved the feeling
that he was part of the crowd, and his mind was stored
with many observations and memories. The romance of
the streets was no idle journalistic phrase to him. He
felt it around him on all sides, plucking at him with alluring
fingers leading him into the land of dreams. Often
at night he would give himself wholly up to its enchantment,
wandering along mile after mile through quaint
byways and on misty commons, through silent Suburbia
and the noisy, restless East-end slums. London was to
him a book of unending pages with countless illustrations.</p>

<p>This afternoon he mingled with the crowd, but he did
not heed it, so that he did not see a woman in a motor
energetically waving her hand to him and directing the
chauffeur to stop.</p>

<p>“Mr. Paton—oh! Mr. Paton, what a day-dream!”</p>

<p>It was Claudia herself, looking altogether charming
in light summer attire. There were waving, greeny-blue
ostrich feathers in her Leghorn hat and around her neck.
The softness of the feathers and the peculiar shade of
blue accentuated the creamy tint of her skin and the
brightness of her eyes. Her happiness shone through
the envelope of the flesh like a flame through clear glass.
A heavy-eyed woman of the lower classes who was passing
marked her and muttered, “She has a good time,
I’ll be bound,” then, wrapped in her own bad one,
passed on.</p>

<p>Paton went up to the car and held out his hand.</p>

<p>“Mr. Paton, you’re just the man I want. Do come
and see some pictures with me. Jujubes hates pictures,
don’t you, Jujubes?” She turned to the faded, amiable
woman beside her in the car.</p>

<p>“I don’t hate them, but they all look so alike,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Jujubes mildly. “When you’ve seen one, it seems to me
you’ve seen the lot.”</p>

<p>“There, listen to this awful heathen who rejoices in
her darkness! Leave me not to her tender mercies.
Jujubes can do some shopping for me.” She looked entreatingly
at him with her fresh young mouth smiling
at herself, Jujubes, Paton and the whole world.</p>

<p>He hesitated for the fraction of a second. Then he
said cheerily: “Of course I’ll come, if only out of kindness
to Miss Jujubes. And I shan’t be seeing any more
English pictures for a long time, I suppose.” Then he
told her of his intended visit to the Argentine.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Claudia blankly. “Oh! I wish you weren’t
going away. I shall miss you so much—we shall all
miss you.” She said it quite naturally as the thought
came to her mind. One could always do that with Colin
Paton.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he said smilingly, as he helped Jujubes
to alight. “It’s very good of you to say so.” He seated
himself beside Claudia.</p>

<p>“Don’t. You needn’t be formal and polite. Why are
you going? Is it the <i lang="de">wanderlust</i> again? Or is it to help
you in your career?”</p>

<p>Gilbert had taught her to think of careers.</p>

<p>“Oh! I shall never have a career,” said Paton lightly,
aware of the soft, dark eyes on his face questioning him.
But he did not meet them. Somehow they held a look
in them to-day that he could not bear. “I don’t concentrate,
you know. I’m just ‘a blooming amateur.’
Gilbert was reading me a solemn lecture the other day,
but—I go on the same old way. I’m glad, however,
that Gilbert is getting on so well. But then, he does
concentrate.”</p>

<p>“He works very hard,” said Claudia thoughtfully, “I
had no idea how hard. He does too much, I think.”
Then she looked at the rather fine lines of the face beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
her. “But I don’t believe you are afraid of hard
work. I remember how hard you worked when you were
on that Hospital Committee.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think it’s that,” said Paton quietly. “Let’s
say it’s lack of ambition and driving power.”</p>

<p>Was there something in his tone that sent a vague
shadow of distrust over Claudia’s expression, or was it
the echo of some secret misgiving in herself?</p>

<p>“Does that mean you think ambition—the ordinary
get-to-the-top-of-the-tree ambition—rather commonplace?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” he said heartily. “After all, we live on
a commonplace earth. Gilbert is right and I am wrong,
and when Gilbert is Lord Chief Justice and I’m an obscure
old bore of a bachelor, I shall, no doubt, fully realize
my wrongness. But do ask me to dinner sometimes.”</p>

<p>“But you mustn’t remain a bachelor,” said Claudia,
with all the enthusiasm of the newly-engaged woman,
“because your life will be incomplete. That sounds like
sex conceit, but you said it yourself to me, and then I
began to believe it. And now——” she completed the
sentence with a charming blush.</p>

<p>“Can you imagine any modern woman wanting a man
without worldly ambition, a man she will never be proud
of, a man who is nothing and does nothing?” The tone
was light enough, and the girl, engrossed in her own happiness,
did not detect an unusual note of bitterness. For
Colin Paton was never bitter. He could be sarcastic
and even scathing when roused, but he never indulged
in the refuge of cowardly souls.</p>

<p>Claudia took him quite seriously, for happiness, just
as sorrow, may temporarily obscure a sense of humour.
“I forbid you to say such things of yourself,” she said,
with an engaging air of motherliness. “You’re awfully
clever—<em>awfully</em> clever. Why, you are one of the best-read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and best-informed men in London.” Suddenly she
realized how often she had turned to him for information
or advice. And she could never remember an occasion
on which he had failed her, or an opinion that her critical
faculty on reflection deemed unsound.</p>

<p>“No market value, dear lady.”</p>

<p>She paused a moment thoughtfully. “Is that true?”
she said slowly. “Gilbert said that the other day when
I asked him if he had read something. He says he has
no time for books, it’s as much as he can do to read
the newspapers.... Somehow it seems all wrong.” She
looked away with a puzzled expression at the trees of
the Park.</p>

<p>He cast a quick glance at her profile and the beautiful
lines of her throat. He seemed about to say something
with unusual impetuosity, and then he resolutely locked
his lips. He allowed her to go on speaking.</p>

<p>“Ambition gets in the way of—of a lot of other things,
doesn’t it? It seems a voracious dragon, swallowing up
everything: friends, books, pictures—all the beautiful,
graceful things of life. Isn’t it a pity?”</p>

<p>“I think so; but then I’m in the minority.”</p>

<p>“And that’s why you are not ambitious,” she flashed
out with sudden insight. “Yes, I see. I wonder if you
are right.” Her voice was a little wistful.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, with resolute reassurance. “No. I’m
wrong, and Gilbert is right. Wife of the Lord Chief
Justice—what greater honour could you wish?”</p>

<p>“Now you are making fun of me,” she replied, with
a tiny frown, “and I was quite serious. It’s difficult to
explain. But—well, I hate the usual sort of man who
does nothing except wear his clothes well, don’t you?
Look at Jack. He sets off his uniform beautifully, but
he just footles his life away. There doesn’t seem anything
between that and great strenuosity—except you. I
can’t place you. Somehow you always make me see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
things in a different perspective from anyone else. I
wonder why it is. Sometimes you make things seem better
and sometimes you make them seem worse.”</p>

<p>He drew in his breath a little and his hand in its thin
suède covering clenched itself on his knee. “Claudia,
you mustn’t let me make things seem worse or any
different from—what they are. I’d be content if my
mission in life were to make things better, not worse,
for you. Not that you want that now,” he added hastily,
pulling himself in. “I know, from things you have left
unsaid, that your home life hasn’t been all you wanted
and ought to have had, but now—now you are going to
be very happy. Gilbert is a splendid fellow.”</p>

<p>She turned to him, her face glowing, her eyes deep
and dark with emotion.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think I am going to be very happy. Somehow
you have always understood. I have never had to tell
you things. You see, nobody ever wanted me very much,
and I—I wanted somebody to want me and to rely on me
and care for my companionship. It is so wonderful to
think that our interests are one, that what interests me
interests him, that I can tell him my good news and bad
news and be always sure that I don’t bore him. I’ve
always had to bottle up things. I’ve had one or two girl
friends, but it isn’t the same. And even then they get
engaged and married and you fall in the background.
But when I’ve got a husband of my own it will be
different, won’t it?”</p>

<p>He hesitated the fraction of a second. “Yes, Claudia,
it will be different. You know how glad I am that you
have found happiness, don’t you? I wanted that so much
for my—friend.”</p>

<p>“And isn’t it nice that I am marrying <em>your</em> friend?”
she exclaimed joyfully. “Because you might not have
liked my husband, or my husband might not have liked
you. Oh, I know,” sagely. “I have heard from my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
friends who got married, that it is sometimes very difficult.
But you and Gilbert are friends, and you and I are
friends. It’s quite ideal, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said cryptically, “quite ideal. The ideal is
always the unattainable.”</p>

<p>“But you must marry too,” she persisted, “because I
am sure I should like your wife. There are some men
that one knows and likes that one feels doubtful about
their choice of a wife, and there are others—like you—one
is sure it will be all right.” She laughed gaily.
“Won’t you get married to please me?”</p>

<p>No one could have guessed there was any effort in his
laughing reply. “I know. You are planning to get rid
of some obnoxious wedding-present on me, something
especially hideous in the way of rose-bowls or tea-services.
No, I absolutely refuse to accommodate you.”</p>

<p>“Well, at least promise me to come back soon,” she
smiled as the motor stopped before the entrance to the
galleries. “I shall want to discuss a thousand things
with you long before you’ve got to the Argentine. I
think I shall keep a little book and call it ‘The Paton
Diary.’ In it I shall enter all sorts of queries and the
names of books and pictures and music that I want to
discuss with you.”</p>

<p>“Heavens! I shall never come back!” Her hand
rested in his as he helped her to alight, and she gave
him a mischievous squeeze.</p>

<p>“No, but really.”</p>

<p>“Really, I will come back as—soon as I can, and I
shall be grateful if the ‘Paton Diary’ will keep my
memory green.... I hear there is a wonderful Giorgione
here. You remember those two we saw here last
year....”</p>

<h3 id="I_CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">A MOTHERS’ MEETING</span></h3>

<p>“Our respected mother has what you would call
a tarnished reputation.” Pat said it in a mild
and thoughtful manner, as she and Claudia exercised
Billie in the Park to try and keep his figure within
reasonable bounds.</p>

<p>“Pat!” exclaimed Claudia, abruptly recalled from
her own thoughts. “You have no right to say such
things.” Sisters who are not yet out and three years
one’s junior must be kept in order.</p>

<p>“Why not? It’s true, I suppose. I was sitting here
among a lot of people yesterday and mother drove by.
The two women at the back began to talk. At first, I
didn’t know they were discussing mother, till they mentioned
you. When they said ‘Her daughter Claudia has
just got engaged to Gilbert Currey, it’s to be hoped she
won’t follow in her mother’s footsteps,’ I twigged.”</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t have listened,” rebuked Claudia indignantly.</p>

<p>“Well, I was hedged in, and I should have had to
plough my way over such a lot of feet to get away,
and I couldn’t turn round and say ‘Excuse me, you’re
discussing my mother and sister,’ could I?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“I should have got up, feet or no feet,” returned her
sister.</p>

<p>“Mother seems to have had a pretty good time, according
to these two women. They rattled off mother’s
amours with great gusto. They were alternately shocked
and envious—the combination was funny.”</p>

<p>“Nasty-minded gossips!”</p>

<p>“I should have liked to turn round and say ‘Sour
grapes.’ I suppose mother <em>has</em> gone the pace. She’s
been a sort of Helen of Troy, hasn’t she? Notorious
for her temperament and beauty.”</p>

<p>“Women like that always invent a lot of scandal.”
Claudia shrugged her shoulders. “It’s a sort of convention
with them to think that all women in society live
immoral lives.... Billie, no, you mustn’t bite little boys’
legs. I know it’s only in play, but they don’t like it.”</p>

<p>“Mother must have been stunning when she was
young, in the days of the portrait,” continued Pat reflectively.
“If I had been a man I should have fallen
in love with her. Nothing mild and namby-pamby for
me, thank you. I’ve a good deal of sympathy with her,
for father is a bore. Only I can’t see how she could
have been in love with so many men. Most men are
so deadly uninspiring. I expect falling in love became
a habit with mother.”</p>

<p>“Really, Pat, I don’t think we ought to discuss
her.”</p>

<p>“Why? Because she is our mother? But she doesn’t
feel like our mother—she told me so the other day—and
she wouldn’t mind our discussing her a bit, just as
though she were next-door neighbour.” Claudia could
not contradict this, for Mrs. Iverson had never tried
or wanted to be a mother to her children. The children
had “happened” and been promptly relegated to the
nursery. As soon as she was well she forgot them just
as she forgot an annoying attack of influenza.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“Claudia, do you feel you could fall in love with a
lot of men?”</p>

<p>“Pat! what awful questions you ask. I should think
that——” She stopped herself. She was going to add,
“No nice woman could fall in love with a lot of men,”
but this would reflect on her mother, and out of loyalty
and decency she could not say it, rather for what her
mother might have been to her than what she was. So
she said instead, “I haven’t thought about it, and if I
were you, I shouldn’t. You’re too young to worry about
sex problems. The little I have thought about them
has only confused me; it seems such an enormous subject.
One would have to be a Methuselah to have time
enough to study it. I am sure threescore years and ten
is too little.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it is all a question of experience,” said Pat
slowly. “If only mother would tell us all she had learned!
That would be better than all the silly morals and
maxims that surround you like a barbed wire fence.”</p>

<p>Claudia stole a glance at Pat as she strode along, her
skin flushed by the warmth of the sun, her corn-coloured
hair glowing under her big white hat. How much did
Pat know of the things she discussed so lightly? How
much did she herself know, for that matter. And yet,
quietly and earnestly, she had been watching men and
women since her <i lang="fr">début</i> a year since. She had seen the
fair surface and some of the dark undercurrent, she
had kept her ears and her eyes open and her mind as
far as possible unbiased, but what was the harvest?
How much did she really <em>know</em>? She did not make
the mistake of thinking men angels or devils, she tried,
on Paton’s advice, not to generalize—the temptation
of youth—she knew that, on the whole, she liked the
masculine sex better than her own, but what did she
know that she could impart to a younger sister? As
she looked at Pat, she wondered if she ought to try and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
find out where Pat stood. Ought she to try and influence
her sister in any way? Pat was such a queer
mixture. Sometimes she talked like an overgrown,
slangy schoolgirl, and the next minute she would speak
with the callous knowledge of a woman of forty; sometimes
she showed signs of deep affection and strong
emotions, which again would give place to a curious
aloofness and independence.</p>

<p>Lady Currey was coming to lunch that day with the
Iversons, an event which Claudia dreaded. Mrs. Iverson
had lazily decided that, under the circumstances, she
ought to offer her some hospitality, and Lady Currey
had felt it only right and fitting to accept. Her husband
was confined to their house in the country with an attack
of gout. Gilbert had pleaded that he was too busy
to accompany her.</p>

<p>Punctually at half-past one—the clock was striking—Lady
Currey arrived. Mrs. Iverson was not down yet,
but she was never punctual, except when her clock was
fast. Claudia had to receive Gilbert’s mother.</p>

<p>She wanted to like her, but her heart sank a little at
Lady Currey’s formal greeting. Sometimes she had
hoped—before she had considered Gilbert in the light
of a possible husband—that when she married, her
husband’s mother might be someone to whom she could,
and would be allowed to, feel daughterly. She knew it
was rare, but she would meet a nice mother-in-law more
than half way, for there was no holy of holies occupied
by a real mother. One could ask Mrs. Iverson’s advice
on dress—not too often, because it bored her to give
advice on any subject—but Claudia felt she had room
in her heart for a nice cosy elderly woman, who might
be a guide, philosopher and friend.</p>

<p>“Mother will be down directly,” said Claudia, with a
heightened colour. “Will you not take this chair? It
is more comfortable than that one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you, but I do not care for those low, padded
chairs. They induce habits of indulgence. I was
brought up to sit on hard, straight-backed chairs, so I
never acquired the habit of lolling.”</p>

<p>She looked critically round the drawing-room, which
was full of graceful and beautiful things. At one end,
looking down insolently upon her, was the famous Circe
picture. It dominated the whole room. The only other
pictures were landscapes, a couple of Olssons, an exquisite
Whistler, which the artist had himself given to
Mrs. Iverson, a Sisley and a small Cézanne. But they
were all subservient to the glowing Circe in her wonderful
clinging blue robes. The whole room had apparently
been designed as a frame for the portrait, for it was a
harmony of dull blues and faded pinks. A case of
miniatures at her elbow contained some exquisite Cosway
beauties and some rare scraps of old Venetian goldsmiths’
work. Lady Currey caught sight of a Vernis
Martin cabinet full of priceless Sèvres and some Chelsea
figures that made the collector’s mouth water. It was
annoying to think that Sybil owned such china, for
Lady Currey was sure she did not value it.</p>

<p>“You have some beautiful pieces here,” she said to
Claudia, crossing to look at the cabinet.</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe they are considered very fine. I am
afraid I don’t know much about china myself.” If
Claudia had only known it, her last chance was
gone. Lady Currey’s eyebrows went up in contempt.
But the china was exquisite and avenged
Claudia’s slip.</p>

<p>Lady Currey turned away and glanced at the clock.
Twenty to two! Where was her hostess?</p>

<p>The door opened, but it was only Patricia with Billie
at her heels. “Billie was crying for you, Claudia. I
let him loose. I thought you had forgotten him.”</p>

<p>Claudia had instinctively felt that Lady Currey was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the type of woman who disapproved of dogs in the
house, so she had tied him up.</p>

<p>Pat surveyed the visitor with her clear blue eyes.
Very precise and a little dowdy did Lady Currey look
that day. Her grey silk was a dull shade, her ornaments
were valuable, but belonged to the day when diamonds
were deeply embedded in gold, her toque was as near
to a bonnet as she could buy. Pat took it all in and her
lips said “prunes and prism” behind their visitor’s back.</p>

<p>“Ripping day, isn’t it?” she said affably. “Doesn’t
it make you feel as if you’d like to turn somersaults on
the grass and yell like a wild Indian every time you
come right side up?”</p>

<p>Claudia stifled a laugh at Lady Currey’s expression.</p>

<p>Of course, Sybil’s children would be terrible and
lawless. She disliked anything so large and athletic as
Pat, and privately thought that so much flesh and bone
inclined to coarseness. She was of the small and tidy
type herself.</p>

<p>“There’s no way of letting off steam nowadays, is
there?” continued Pat, unabashed by Lady Currey’s
stare, and crossing her legs so as to display a large expanse
of silk-covered calf. “That’s why people get
into mischief. They boil up inside, sometimes you can
<em>feel</em> the bubbles!”</p>

<p>“That’s because you’re a very young kettle,” interposed
Claudia hastily.</p>

<p>But at that moment—five minutes to two—Sybil
Iverson glided into the room. Her figure was still wonderful,
willowy and most seductive in its lissomness. She
was wearing a dress that showed every curve of it, and
the transparent guimpe of her bodice showed the gleam
of her neck in a manner that Lady Currey found very
indecent. Her hair, burnished and waved in a carefully
negligent fashion, matched her slightly tinted complexion.
The whole effect was pleasingly artificial, like that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
some rare orchid. She was still Circe—after a careful
toilette.</p>

<p>“Ah! Marian, what a long time since we met! But
you are just the same.”</p>

<p>“We are both considerably older,” said the companion
of her girlhood with emphasis.</p>

<p>“Are we really? I have ceased to be a body, I am
now only a spirit, and spirits know no age.” She let
her heavy lids drop over her eyes, a trick which Lady
Currey had always disliked. “I have learned to project
the soul into space and leave the body behind. Have
you ever pierced through the intangible walls of the Unseen,
Marian?”</p>

<p>“I attend regularly to my religious duties,” said her
visitor shortly, rather nonplussed by Circe’s new attitude.
Her flippancies she knew and could meet, but this was
something that verged on her own preserves.</p>

<p>“Ah! that is not quite the same.” The hostess smiled
sweetly upon her. “But now we will go in to lunch.
Gilbert is not coming, I think?”</p>

<p>“He has his work,” said his mother. “You cannot
expect such a man to dance attendance on a woman.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I quite understand,” interjected Claudia. “I
did not expect he would come.”</p>

<p>“He has the aura of a successful man.” said Circe
dreamily. “I saw it quite distinctly last night. But
there was something mingled with it—I saw a vivid streak
of purple——” She shook her head mysteriously and
broke off the sentence.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t say there were any purple patches about
Gilbert,” smiled Claudia, across the rose-bowl.</p>

<p>“I do not understand the phrase,” said Lady Currey
acidly. “Will you explain it to me?”</p>

<p>Patricia gave an audible chuckle, and Claudia looked
imploringly at her mother.</p>

<p>“Purple patches,” said Circe vaguely, “stand for all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the wonderful emotions and sensations that make this
life a thing of magic and mystery. A purple patch—what
is it? It may be a minute, a second even—the look from
someone’s eyes caught in a crowd—a chord of music—a
whiff of perfume—an hour of passion—a day of memories—the
song of a bird—anything rare and evanescent.
Purple patches are moments of crystallization, of ecstasy,
of poetry, of life; patches that glow in your heart for
years and I think, even when you are dead shroud it in
royal mourning.”</p>

<p>She came out of her dream and took the salmon
mayonnaise that the butler had been patiently holding.</p>

<p>“I am glad to think there are no purple patches on
my son,” said his mother dryly, dubbing her hostess “a
mass of affectation.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think a successful barrister would be
likely to stray into Wonderland. Documents of the law,
blue paper and crude red tape do not harmonize with
purple, do they? Claudia, will you remember that when
I die I want to be buried in purple silk and the coffin
must be lined with a deep shade of crimson. I think I
might select the colours when I have time. The wrong
crimson would be so fatal to my hair.”</p>

<p>Billie suddenly gave a little howl from his seat on the
sofa as though the conversation depressed him. Lady
Currey looked her disapproval of him, and Claudia
shushed him.</p>

<p>Then she tried to change the subject in deference to
the dachshund’s tender feelings.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it delightful, Lady Currey? I had a letter from
father’s old friend, the Countess Ravogli, this morning,
sending her congratulations and offering us her beautiful
villa on the Lake of Como for the honeymoon. I
have seen photographs of it, and it is too sweet for
words.”</p>

<p>“Does Gilbert like the idea?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“I haven’t told him yet, but he is sure to like it. It
is a sort of fairy castle with an enchanted garden full
of wonderful sculpture and strange flowers. There is a
terrace of white marble brought from Greece and a fountain
of coloured waters. It must be perfectly delicious. I
have always dreamed of it as an ideal honeymoon place.”</p>

<p>“One must be very young to look well in such a
place,” said her mother. “The Countess tried to get me
to visit her, but I declined. White marble is only suitable
to the eternal youth of gods and goddesses and it
is so chilly! A marble terrace always sounds delightful,
but as a matter of fact it generally gives you cold feet
and you have to fly in and demand hot-water bottles,
and there is nothing romantic about a hot-water bottle.”</p>

<p>“The drinking-water is so bad in Italy,” remarked
Lady Currey. “I do hope you will be careful.”</p>

<p>After luncheon, Mrs. Iverson carried off Lady Currey
to her boudoir on the plea of reviving old memories.
Claudia was relieved, but surprised, for her mother
seldom took any but her very special cronies into her
private apartments.</p>

<p>Circe lit a cigarette—the room was already heavy with
some Oriental perfume which made Lady Currey sniff—and
made herself thoroughly comfortable and picturesque
on a low divan. Lady Currey told herself that it was
exactly like a room in a harem, never having been in
one.</p>

<p>“It is strange your boy should be marrying my girl,”
commenced Mrs. Iverson, watching the pearly grey
smoke rise in the air. “I confess I thought Claudia would
have married quite differently.” Her voice was dangerously
sweet.</p>

<p>“Indeed,” said Lady Currey. The perfume irritated
her, and she felt a desire to sneeze.</p>

<p>“Yes, quite differently. But neither her father nor I
would try to interfere with her choice. I have always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
allowed my children full liberty of action. And though
Claudia would have had an enviable position as the
Duchess of Swansea, I recognize her right to choose as
her heart dictates. I saw the Duke last night, and he
was very downcast. He thought Claudia might relent.
Charming fellow, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>She opened her eyes blandly upon her visitor, and
nothing but good will to men and contempt for women
shone from them.</p>

<p>Lady Currey, who moved very little in London society
now, did not personally know Swansea, but knew him
to be one of the most eligible <i lang="fr">partis</i> of the day. She
had heard a vague rumour of Swansea’s attentions to
Claudia from another quarter and saw no reason to
doubt Circe’s news. She was nettled, and felt she was
being placed in a false position. It revived old memories.
Circe had possessed this trick as a young girl.</p>

<p>“Gilbert is bound to do well,” she said hastily.</p>

<p>“Of course.” Circe lit another cigarette. “But the
future—well, it is the future! Futures are like horses—you
can never count on them! If they could only invent
automatic horses and automatic futures! Still, I have
no doubt he will arrive one day, if Claudia is patient.
Personally, I should have no patience to wait for a
future.”</p>

<p>“Gilbert will make an excellent husband.” Lady
Currey, to her great amazement, perceived that she was
actually holding a brief for Gilbert. The thing was
absurd.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” murmured her old friend vaguely. “But
all the old-fashioned virtues are so out of date now, like
four-wheelers and stage-coaches. The modern excellent
husband is such a different article from what we called
an excellent husband fifty years ago. I often think what
a dreadful bore that good, old-fashioned husband must
have been. I am sure those Early Victorian wives must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
have died of their partners’ excellences. Have you
noticed how sad they always look in their portraits?”</p>

<p>“In my young days marriage was considered a sacrament,”
remarked Lady Currey stiffly, glancing out of the
corner of her eye at a notable array of masculine portraits.
“I consider the interpretation and shortening of
the marriage service nowadays scandalous. The Bishop
of Dorminster quite agrees with me.”</p>

<p>“I am sure he would. If you sell patent medicines,
you must believe in patent medicines.... Why don’t you
start a campaign against it? I can see you at the head
of a flourishing Anti society. I would join it with pleasure,
Marian.”</p>

<p>Lady Currey stiffened. “Gilbert has very nice ideas
about women.”</p>

<p>“What are nice ideas about women, Marian?”</p>

<p>“He treats women with respect and proper deference.”</p>

<p>“How dull!” murmured Circe, looking at the portrait
of a man who had not treated her with undue respect.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon?”</p>

<p>“I said how delightful. But I hope he can—er—offer
Claudia something more than respect. I hope he appreciates
her and can offer a good deal of love and admiration.
Some people set a great store by love—I fancy
Claudia does. You see, that would be the one thing—you
will forgive my speaking frankly like an old friend—that
would compensate her father and me for a less
good match than we had the right to expect. We want
her to be happy, but Claudia is very much admired. She
has had many good offers—I know, though she hasn’t
told me—and I should feel a little sad if I thought
Gilbert did not adore her. She is really rather a dear.
I quite admire her myself, and I admire very few
women.”</p>

<p>There was a short pause while Lady Currey struggled
for words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>“I—I believe he is very much in love with her,” she
said at last, flushing angrily.</p>

<p>“Ah! that is what I brought you up here to know.
Love compensates for any worldly loss, does it not?...
Dear Marian, I am afraid I must go out now, but it is
charming to think that your son is going to marry
Claudia. It reunites us again in the bonds of friendship.
I am sure Gilbert is charming. Claudia is a lucky girl.”</p>

<p>Lady Currey was not to be outdone. She rose primly
in her grey silk.</p>

<p>“Claudia is very handsome. It is Gilbert who is
lucky.”</p>

<p>Thus ended a little Mothers’ Meeting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="I_CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">“LOVE IS THE ONLY CONVENTION”</span></h3>

<p>Claudia was spending the week-end out of town
at Holme Court, Wargrave, where one of her
aunts, Mrs. Armesby Croft, always spent a good part of
the summer. Gilbert had also been invited and her
brother Jack, but Jack had refused to go.</p>

<p>She was coming down the stairs on the Friday morning
and heard a familiar whistling. Jack’s door was
open, and the musical-comedy tune—rather flat—proceeded
from his room.</p>

<p>“Jack, I do wish you wouldn’t whistle so flat. Can’t
you get your whistle manicured, or something?”</p>

<p>“Hallo! Claud, that you? Come in, I’m nearly all
there.”</p>

<p>The late hours he habitually kept had not yet left
any mark on Jack Iverson. This morning he looked
wonderfully young and fresh, although he had not
tumbled into bed until past three. Youth has a magnificent
elasticity, and he looked like a modern god that
has tubbed and shaved and is ready for a good breakfast.</p>

<p>“Why aren’t you coming down to Wargrave?” inquired
Claudia, sauntering into his apartment. “It’s
just the week-end for the river.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I <em>am</em> going on the river,” said Jack, with a
knowing air, settling his tie in the mirror. “I’ve had
on seven ties this morning. How’s this one?”</p>

<p>“Looks all right. I don’t notice anything wrong, so I
suppose it’s all right. That’s the test of men’s dressing,
isn’t it? Why not Wargrave?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“Because, though Aunt Margaret is a clinking good
sort and keeps a jolly good table, she is not a ravishing
companion. You’re only my sister, and—’nuff said.”</p>

<p>Claudia looked at him, and her lip curled. “That
means you are going up the river with a ravishing companion,
I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Thou supposeth rightly, oh, wise one! She’s just
the most fascinating thing you ever struck.”</p>

<p>“Which musical comedy?” queried Claudia, running
her eyes over the collection of invitation cards and pretty
women on his mantelshelf. The portraits had inscriptions
on them of considerable fervour, and she noticed
a family resemblance in the handwritings, which were
either sprawly or very dashing, with huge flourishes at
the end like a stockwhip in action.</p>

<p>“Never you mind. But she’s a duck, the very thing
for a steam-launch. Got the neatest thing in ankles you
ever saw. Beastly taking a woman with thick ankles
on the river. They’re best hidden under a dinner-table.”</p>

<p>“Can she talk about anything?” asked Claudia curiously,
picking up a photograph of a smile and a
shoulder.</p>

<p>“She can talk well enough when she wants to. Oh!
I know you, Claudia, we’ve had this discussion before.
I’ve told you I don’t like clever women. I hate a girl
who wants to impress you and talks like a smart novel.
Give me a nice, affectionate little thing who’s got a
string of funny stories and doesn’t make too many demands
on a fellow. She’s worth a hundred clever
women, with their soaring nonsense.”</p>

<p>“Is she?” Claudia looked at him thoughtfully as he
put his watch in his waistcoat. “I often wonder why you
and men like you prefer to spend your time with—well,
affectionate little things, rather than with girls in your
own set. Personally, I can’t understand your taste. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
am sure these girls have common ways and petty
thoughts. I couldn’t stand a musical-comedy man for
five minutes.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s different. The men are awful bounders;
you’re quite right. I’d like to see one of them make up
to you!”</p>

<p>“Why is it so different?”</p>

<p>“Well, it is. I can’t explain things like that to you,
but it is. You’re brainy, old girl, and I don’t pretend
to be brainy. A lot of good brains do a woman, unless
she’s a schoolmistress. Not that Ruby is stupid. She’s—well,
she’s bright, if you know what I mean. She
knows how to get what she wants, and knows her way
about.”</p>

<p>“The cleverness of the gamin,” observed Claudia coolly.</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, she’s clever enough for me. You can
be easy and comfortable with her, and she’s an amusing
companion. Doesn’t go in for moods and all that nonsense.
I like ’em bright and chirpy, I confess. If you
girls only knew how your confounded moods and fancies
bore a fellow. Why, look at <em>you</em>. You’re full of whims
and fancies. You can be an awfully good companion if
you like—none better; but one never knows what you
will want the next moment. You women expect us to
transpose ourselves to your key every few minutes. It’s
a damned nuisance, Claudia. Take my advice, don’t try
too many moods on with Gilbert.”</p>

<p>“You think there is much in common between you
and Gilbert?” Claudia’s voice was sarcastic.</p>

<p>“Yes more than you think,” flashed out Jack unexpectedly.
“Oh! I know all about his brains, but otherwise
he’s much the same as me. He doesn’t care enough
about women generally to make a study of ’em.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of that.”</p>

<p>“He’s too indifferent, and I’m too lazy,” continued
young Iverson, bent on pursuing his train of thought.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
“I daresay women are nice to me because I’ve got plenty
of money—you are right in some cases—but as long as
they are nice, what matters?”</p>

<p>“From your point of view, not at all, if you only
want a woman as a mere plaything, to smile automatically
the moment you appear, and produce a funny story when
you turn a handle. You want a doll, Jack, not a woman,
a pretty, jointed doll, that squeaks ‘darling’ when you
come up to it, and which you can pick up when you like
and drop when you like.”</p>

<p>“My dear girl,” said Jack, with a condescending smile
“you can’t understand. Women never do understand
these things. They talk a lot about sex nowadays, but
it’s all talk. The proposition is quite a simple one, if
you women wouldn’t wrap it up with complexities.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad I don’t understand,” she returned
warmly. “And if I were a man I don’t think I should
understand either. I hope I should be more fastidious.”
She pounced on a jeweller’s morocco case. “Hallo!
May I look, Jack?”</p>

<p>Jack nodded. He rather liked Claudia when she was
not too brainy and analytical.</p>

<p>She opened the case with a click. It contained a very
handsome pendant with pearl drop and a big ruby in
the centre.</p>

<p>“Pretty, isn’t it?” said Jack complacently. “The ruby
was my own idea—her name—d’yer see?”</p>

<p>“Quite subtle,” said Claudia gravely; “but I daresay,
if you explain it, she’ll see the point.”</p>

<p>“Eh? Oh, well! they like a little present occasionally.
And if you saw her pleasure at anything you give her—well,
you feel you want to go and buy her the whole
shopfull at once.”</p>

<p>“H’m. I think I was wrong in suggesting she was not
clever. Let’s go down to breakfast, Jacky.”</p>

<p>“You see,” said Jack confidentially, as they went down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the stairs, “a fellow likes to be appreciated. You remember
that, my dear, now you are going to be married.
Don’t have any moods, and always be appreciative and
bright. That does the trick every time. Take my
advice.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. I’ll be sure and remember. Appreciative
and bright. I might have it framed.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you fancy I don’t know anything about women.
You’re a nut, Claudia, I admire you no end, but really
you make too great demands on a chap. Come on, I
could eat a tin can this morning.”</p>

<p>Later that day Claudia was lying very comfortably in
a big wicker chair under an old elm-tree at Holme Court,
when Gilbert arrived. He looked noticeably tired and
fagged, for the week had been a very hot one, and he
had been hard at it. He did not specially remark the
pretty picture she made in her cool white linen against
the green background, but he appreciated the shade of
the elm. His chambers were abominably stuffy.</p>

<p>“Poor boy!” said Claudia softly. “You’re tired, I
can see. I’ll be soothing. You don’t want me to tell
funny stories, do you?”</p>

<p>Gilbert’s eyes opened in blank surprise, but he caught
the twinkle in her eyes, and the smouldering laugh in
the corners of her mouth as she watched him. He knew
there was a joke somewhere, but he was much too hot
and tired to worry it out. Instead he looked at Claudia’s
mouth, which was soft and red, with a most provocative
pout.</p>

<p>“It’s too warm even to laugh. But it’s nice and cool
here.” He dropped into a chair with a huge sigh of
content.</p>

<p>“We are all alone here,” said Claudia happily. “The
others have gone on the river, but I waited for you.”
There was no one in sight except a couple of birds hopping
about in search of a worm. “I am going to give you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
some tea out here, and then we will go down and get
one of the boats out.” She dropped a kiss on his hair,
which already had several silver threads in it. “I thought
I’d stop and mother a poor tired boy! Somehow—wasn’t
it ridiculous of me?—I fancied you would like
to have me all to yourself.” She laughed a little. “It’s
rather nice to have someone to pet and fuss over. I’ve
never had anyone who would let me do it. Mother hates
us even to kiss her—we do it once a year, at Christmas,
when we thank her for her present—and Pat is too tom-boyish
to like being petted. I had to fall back on Billie.
He can stand any amount of it, but still—well, he’s only
a dog.”</p>

<p>“Does that mean I have cut out Billie,” said Gilbert
lazily. Her hands, with their soft, rather mesmeric
finger-tips, gave him agreeable sensations in keeping with
idle hours and summer days.</p>

<p>“No, it doesn’t. As a matter of fact I feel so happy
that I could pet the whole world!”</p>

<p>“A tall order! But, I say, I’d rather you didn’t do it
to the masculine half. They might misunderstand your
mothering instinct.”</p>

<p>She laughed and dropped another kiss on his hair
before she went back to her seat among the cushions.
Involuntarily he put up his hand and smoothed his hair,
which was in no way disturbed. It was thick and
straight, and spoke of his abundant energy.</p>

<p>“Gilbert! Don’t brush my kisses off. You are
ungallant.”</p>

<p>“Sorry, dear. I didn’t mean to brush them off, but
a man hates the idea that his hair has got ruffled.”</p>

<p>“That’s because you are afraid of looking ridiculous!
Men are very dignified animals, aren’t they? I believe
you’re a particularly dignified, conventional specimen!”</p>

<p>The maid was approaching with the tea-tray. As she
came across the lawn, the silver caught the rays of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
sun and threw them back in radiant shafts of light. The
maid’s cap and apron seemed dazzlingly white against
the green and blue of the sky and garden.</p>

<p>“Of course, I’m conventional,” responded Gilbert.
“Haven’t you discovered that before? Only weak people
are unconventional.”</p>

<p>Claudia pondered this saying as she watched the maid
arrange the table.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that is altogether true,” she said at
length, taking hold of the teapot.</p>

<p>“Of course not. Nothing is altogether true and
nothing is altogether false. Plenty of milk, please.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I have a conventional, tidy mind. I
can imagine myself doing quite unconventional things,
and I don’t believe I should realize they were unconventional
till I looked back.”</p>

<p>“That’s having no mind at all.” He looked at her
teasingly. “The little pink abominations out of the cake-basket,
please.”</p>

<p>“And then you’d be terribly shocked and put on your
barrister air, and say ‘Didn’t you know that ...?’ You
don’t altogether hold a brief for conventionality, do
you?”</p>

<p>“It’s the safest and most convenient path,” he said,
stirring his tea. “Personally, I have no quarrel with
convention.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe that circumstances may sometimes
force you to do unconventional things when convention
means death to the spirit?”</p>

<p>“I make allowances for weakness, because weakness
is the rule and strength the exception. The world gets
weaker-willed and more neurotic every day. That’s why
one hears so much talk of ‘individuality,’ ‘independence,’
et cetera. More cake, please.”</p>

<p>Claudia shook her head, not at the request for more
cake, but at his dicta.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s not right. You are making no allowance for
temperament. Sometimes it’s really brave to be unconventional.”</p>

<p>“More often weak and cowardly,” retorted Gilbert,
“and the unconventional people usually put other people
in a hopeless mess.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you were ever tempted to do anything
unconventional.” Claudia looked at him, and it
crossed her mind that he was very unlike her mother’s
friends.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t pretend to have withstood great temptations
in that line. ‘Trespassers will be prosecuted’
doesn’t enrage me. I put the same notice-board on my
own property, and am content.”</p>

<p>“I see. Will that notice-board cover—your wife?”
She was smiling at him, but there was a hint of earnest
in the dark eyes.</p>

<p>“Most certainly, madam. The rest of the world may
admire you—from a safe distance.” He found her
looking very pretty behind the silver, the sun through
the green branches just flecking her hair. “I warn you
I should not make a complaisant husband if I found
someone trespassing.” He laughed as he said it, but
there was a decided champ of his jaws, which she noticed
and secretly admired.</p>

<p>“And I shouldn’t be marrying you if I thought you
would,” she replied, with a sudden touch of fire in her
voice. “One sees so much of that and it is so—so
horrible. One despises the husband more than the wife.”
Then she went on more slowly. “I think most women
feel the same about it, although they say they want perfect
freedom in such matters. Women are playing a
game of bluff nowadays. They don’t want a husband
to be complaisant.”</p>

<p>He looked across at her, and his mother’s warnings
came back to him. Claudia like her mother? Why,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
she had just naively acknowledged that she only wanted
to be dominated by a strong man. Geoffrey Iverson had
always been a slackster. A weak man makes a Circe. If
a man cannot hold a woman, he deserves and must expect
to lose her. Life to-day is not so far removed from
savagery after all. The strong man always wins. And
had he not won so far all along the line? Had he not
taken and kept all that he needed? His mother did not
understand that there was no cause to fear. A palmist
had once told him that he possessed an indomitable will.
He knew that she was right. His thoughts flew back,
induced by the peace and quiet, to the last few years at
the Bar. He had out-distanced all his rivals. Men
who had eaten their dinners at the same time as he
were still unknown, briefless. And some of them had
shown brilliant promise, some of them had worked hard,
too. He knew that already, although he was so young,
there was a rumour that he might shortly be taking silk.</p>

<p>Claudia, her chin propped on the palm of her hand,
had been watching him, and with a woman’s swift uncanny
intuition she knew that he had ceased to think of
her, that she had lost touch with him. With a touch of
jealousy she cried:</p>

<p>“Gilbert, come back to me. Of what were you
thinking?”</p>

<p>He came back at once, but without the faintest comprehension
that she had felt left out in the cold, had
divined that she had a serious rival.</p>

<p>“Suppose I say I was thinking of nothing in
particular?”</p>

<p>She shook her head. “It wouldn’t be true. You were
thinking of something that pleased you and—and interested
you enormously. Your eyes were dark with
thought, and there was a glint in them—— Ah! you
were back in your chambers with your briefs?”</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I was right. You had deliberately left this
sweet, sunny garden and—and me, and gone back to
those stuffy chambers. We haven’t seen one another for
four days, and you’d gone back to your work.”</p>

<p>There was an edge to her voice that roused him.</p>

<p>“Claudia, dear, I am very happy here with you, but
one can’t control one’s thoughts or shut watertight doors
on one’s affairs. A woman’s life is different. Men cannot
help mingling their business with their pleasure.”</p>

<p>“You mean we have nothing else to think of but
you?” She threw up her head at an angle which was
particularly becoming, and showed the softness and
whiteness of her throat in the collarless dress.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “but you haven’t any big objective
in life. My dear Claudia, if you understood the keen
competition nowadays, you wouldn’t mind a man’s
thoughts straying back to the fray. You don’t really,
you are much too clever to want a stupid, love-sick
swain who can talk or think of nothing else but love.
You have said many times that you are in complete
sympathy with my ambitions. Don’t be feminine and
illogical. I was flattering myself”—he put his hand on
hers with his most engaging smile—“that I had won
a super-feminine and logical wife.”</p>

<p>“I am in sympathy with you Gilbert.” She carefully
kept her eyes from his face, as though that would break
the chain of her thoughts. “And I don’t want you to
be a stupid, love-sick swain, but——” How could she
make him understand without seeming petty and unreasonable?
“Gilbert,” she went on quickly, determined
to say frankly what she was thinking, “is everything in
your life subservient to your work? Sometimes you
talk as if everything else—as though we were the rungs
upon which you mounted the ladder. When you talk
of wasting time—things being trivial and not worth
while—your face becomes so contemptuous and hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and engrossed it makes me frightened. I want you
to have a career; I wouldn’t have married an idle
man. I will help you in every way I can; I shan’t expect
impossible attention—but, Gilbert, I want our
marriage to mean something to you, a big something.”</p>

<p>She paused for breath, and he opened his lips to
speak, but she signed to him to be silent.</p>

<p>“Let me finish. I couldn’t bear to think that your
work was everything to you, and that I—I was merely
the <i lang="de">Hausfrau</i> that bore your name and sat at your table.
It might be enough for some women, but it wouldn’t be
enough for me. I warn you that if you ever let me drop
into the background of life I—I don’t know what
I might not do. I told you just now that I wasn’t conventional.
Love is the only convention that I own.
Gilbert, tell me something quite truthfully. If I am
asking things you can’t give me, let us break off the
engagement before it is too late. I want”—her voice
broke a little and her eyes were dimmed with feeling—“I
want a great deal of love. I’ve never had it, you know,
and I—I’m so hungry. If I didn’t love you, I shouldn’t
be talking like this. You know I love you; but you—you—Gilbert——”</p>

<p>She had risen from her seat and faced him. She was
very much in earnest, and her mouth trembled like a
child’s. Her full, rounded bosoms under the linen and
lace heaved with her quick heart-beats; her eyes asked
piteously for love.</p>

<p>She was very beautiful in that moment. She was
young and fresh and fragrant, with not a touch of artifice
about her. There was no man alive that would not
have been touched by her beautiful, pleading eyes. She
promised so much. The hint of passion in her eyes and
colouring would have allured any man, and Gilbert was
by nature a passionate animal. Passion and ambition had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
warred from his youth, and he had deliberately crushed
out his warm human instincts. Until he met Claudia
they had been absolutely under control. Now, as on the
night he had proposed to her, something swept over him
like a huge wave and swamped his brain. He only knew
that he desired this girl and that he had never been
thwarted in anything he had set his heart upon. He
did love her; what more could she want? She was
young and immature; she did not understand that man’s
feelings may be the deeper for not finding constant expression.
Later, when they were married, she would
understand better.</p>

<p>He forgot they were in the garden of Holme Court—in
his cooler moments he was desperately afraid of any
demonstrations of affection—and he sprang to his feet
and caught her in his strong arms. He showered kisses
on her passionate, trembling lips, kisses that sent a wild
thrill of fearful joy through her, that made the placid,
sunny garden rock and reel before her eyes, and gave
her a vivid glimpse of what marriage might mean. And
no man had ever roused her passions before. This man
had always had the power to do so since the dinner-party
when he had held her hand in his and asked if he
might claim the privileges of old friendship and call her
Claudia. Something had stirred uneasily then.</p>

<p>“If—if he has this power over me, if he can rouse the
woman in me,” she reasoned, “he must be the right man,
the man I should marry.” It was the simple, true mating
of Nature. Surely, surely all would be well?</p>

<p>“You do—you do love me very much, don’t you? I
am more to you than your work?”</p>

<p>Her lips had intoxicated him so that he would have
told her any lie so that she did not elude him. But he
really thought he was speaking the truth, that there was
something more than mere sex attraction between them.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” he cried fiercely, with the conquering note<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of the male; “can’t you feel?—don’t you know?—kiss
me, kiss me——”</p>

<p>It was several minutes before they went back to the
pink abominations and the more sober discussion of
their wedding.</p>

<p>Yes, Mrs. Currey was “at home,” the butler admitted,
opening the doors hospitably.</p>

<p>By the hats and overcoats lying about the spacious
hall of their flat in Albert Hall Mansions, Carey Image
knew he was not the only man who had hastened to congratulate
Claudia on her husband’s latest honour. He
had seen the announcement in the papers that morning.
Gilbert Currey had been made a K.C. Image immediately
sent a wire to his chambers, and now in person
was giving himself the pleasure of calling on his “god-daughter
by marriage,” as he called her.</p>

<p>The honour was no surprise to anyone; for the last
year or more rumour had marked him out for this distinction.
There had even been vague whispers of coming
glory in the church at his wedding, eighteen months
before. But now Gilbert had stepped into the vacancy
left by the death of Howard Barnes, that blunt and
sarcastic personality who, under a forbidding exterior,
had hidden the heart of a child.</p>

<p>Image had seen very little of the pair since their
marriage, for he who has once roamed in the Orient
never settles down for long in the dull, tidy lands of the
West, and though Cary Image had fully intended to
stop in England, he had broken his resolve a few weeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
after the ceremony. Japan with her slender golden
fingers had beckoned him and he had gone back to the
land of almond blossom and universal courtesy.</p>

<p>The room overlooking the Park which he entered,
unusually large and lofty for a London flat, seemed
crowded to his near-sighted eyes. There was an animated
chatter of voices, for Claudia had already gathered
around her an amusing and socially attractive set, who
talked well and easily, and required but little “managing.”
Image’s bright eyes peered out through his eyeglasses
in search of his hostess.</p>

<p>She soon came towards him with her most hospitable
and welcoming smile. She was always pleased to see
him or receive one of his long, descriptive letters. She
liked him and she liked his life-story. Gilbert generally
spoke of him a little slightingly.</p>

<p>“Welcome, godfather; I’m delighted to see you.
You’ve neglected me shamefully of late. From what
part of the world have you come?”</p>

<p>“Last of all from Paris, <i lang="fr">chère madame</i>, and this morning
I saw the announcement in the paper. Gilbert is
forging ahead. My heartiest congratulations to his
charming partner. What could one not hope to do with
such a one!”</p>

<p>She listened with a conventional smile, but her eyes
did not warm to any enthusiasm as she said lightly,
“Thank you, but I have had nothing to do with it.
Such a <em>partner</em> as I”—there was a slight emphasis on the
word—“is not entitled to claim any share in the congratulations.”</p>

<p>“That is not true,” said Image warmly; “a wife is
the closest and best partner a man can have; and I am
sure, if the truth were known, that most of our famous
men owed much of their success to their wives’ co-operation.
The partner in the house is often far more
important than the partner in the office.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mr. Image, you really are the most refreshing
person,” said a studiously lazy voice from under an
enormous mass of lancer plumes at his left. “Isn’t he,
Claudia? You are the one faithful appreciative soul in
a multitude of scoffers howling in the wilderness. You
almost induce a woman to believe in herself.”</p>

<p>Image laughed and peered under the feathery erection
to discover that it was Rhoda Carnegie, a cousin of
Claudia’s and a woman he had known in Society for
many years. She was married to an unsuccessful playwright,
a “one play” man, who on the strength of a
singleton had induced her to marry him, to their mutual
regret. Some people raved about her beauty in superlatives,
while others merely dubbed her “queer-looking.”
No one refrained from expressing an opinion about her.
Her looks and manners were of the arrogant “I-must-be-obeyed”
order, and she had a reputation for being
irresistible where she chose to charm.</p>

<p>“Ah! Mrs. Carnegie, I could not see who it was. How
do you do? I am so glad you agree with me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t in the least,” she responded languidly, through
half-shut eyes. “It’s only bad women who play a big
part in men’s lives; that’s why I gave up being good.
The nice, virtuous, sympathetic wife is—just a super
most of the time, unnoticed in the wings. And who
wants to be super?”</p>

<p>With a careless laugh Claudia moved away to greet a
new arrival. Rhoda Carnegie watched her with a sort
of detached, cold-blooded speculation.</p>

<p>“Claudia was never cut out to be a super. I see signs
that she will shortly get beyond that stage, for Gilbert
gives no one a chance to distinguish himself. He always
plays lead. But Claudia is not her mother’s daughter
for nothing,” she drawled, playing with a set of golden
baubles in her lap. She had but a small income of her
own and her husband had less, but Rhoda Carnegie was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
noted for her extravagance. How she got her very
handsome toilettes was a mystery. At least, perhaps it
was not an insolvable one to those who knew her well;
but a mystery is always more decent than a scandal.</p>

<p>Image listened, rather startled. Then he remembered
the type of woman to whom he was speaking. It was
said that she made an art of demolishing reputations in
as few words as possible.</p>

<p>“I find her looking exceedingly well,” he said, trying
to change the subject; “and you, also,” he added
courteously.</p>

<p>She looked up at him through her narrow slits of eyes,
a trick which some men found fascinating.</p>

<p>“Claudia is the type that goes on getting better-looking
until she arrives at the age of fifty, then she remains
handsome and distinguished, especially when her hair
gets white. It’s a good job our styles don’t clash, or I
should have to avoid her. But we are quite different.
She is the charming, sympathetic, give-all type which has
its admirers, and I—I hold men with a whip, which I
don’t hesitate to use. You know the play <cite>Doormats</cite>?
Well, I am the boot.” She laughed insolently. “Now
<em>you</em> like the Claudia type. So does Frank Hamilton.”</p>

<p>“Frank Hamilton? Is that the new artist that——”</p>

<p>“Yes, Claudia has made a success of him. She first
introduced him socially, and they say he is deluged with
commissions for portraits. He isn’t as strong as Sargent
or Lavery, and I shouldn’t wonder if he fizzles out, but
he has a trick of pleasing his sitters and doing very
graceful work. I believe he is doing a portrait of
Claudia. That is he over there.”</p>

<p>She pointed quite openly with her fingers to a young
man who stood at Claudia’s elbow, holding some cigarettes.
There was something in his very attitude that
suggested his admiration for his hostess.</p>

<p>Image saw a tall, broad-shouldered, but loose-jointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
figure, that spoke more of the studio than the cricket-field.
His features were good, graceful rather than
strong, and the whole face, he could see, would be one
that would please women. His hazel eyes had an appealing,
rather wistful look in them, and his mouth, if
rather weak, spoke of a taste for and appreciation of
beauty and luxury.</p>

<p>“Claudia should prove a good subject for his brush,”
said Image, exchanging a nod with a foreign diplomatist
whom he knew. “I have heard people speak of him
and predict great things for his future.”</p>

<p>“Mostly women, I suppose? Women like him and
men—are not keen about him. But then he’s not keen
on them. Women fill the bill. A good many of them
are taking him up, and I don’t think his head can stand
it. He hates me like poison. He loves to talk about
himself, and I love and intend to talk about myself. He
told a dear friend of mine, who never loses an opportunity
of repeating the nasty things that are said about
me, that I had the eyes of a Lucretia Borgia.”</p>

<p>“I have always wondered what colour they really are,”
said Image, playing up to her obvious lead.</p>

<p>She smiled. “Continue—to wonder! That is the
way to make men think about you. An ounce of conjecture
is worth a hundredweight of knowledge where
women are concerned.... Good gracious, Patricia, is
there any more of you to unwind? I thought it was a
boa-constrictor standing on his hind legs. Haven’t you
stopped growing?”</p>

<p>“In stature—yes.” She was more of an Amazon than
ever as she rose from somewhere behind the piano. She
gripped Image by the hand, and it was a real grip.</p>

<p>“How about goodness?” queried Rhoda.</p>

<p>“A non-starter—the handicap frightens me. We are
not a good family, you know.... What a lot of people
and congratulations! I should have thought Gilbert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
might have got home early to have relieved his wife’s
blushes, and given himself a sort of holiday treat.”</p>

<p>“Working as hard as ever?”</p>

<p>“Harder. I annoyed him the other day by predicting
a nerve-breakdown—he was playing golf so badly—in a
couple of years. And that same night at dinner he was
so dead tired or cross that he hardly said a word, and
I was left to talk to a boy I’d refused the night before.
He was sulky and devoted himself to his food. I had a
beastly time. I told Gilbert that he fancied he was an
indestructible machine, and that he would find he wasn’t.
Anyway, he hates dinner-parties, and he begins to show
it in his manners.”</p>

<p>“If I were Claudia I should leave him at home,” said
Rhoda coolly. “I always leave mine at home. I tell
people not to invite him. A husband is always the
skeleton at the feast.”</p>

<p>“Why have a husband at all?” said Pat lightly, who
knew her Rhoda.</p>

<p>“It’s a bad habit we shall outgrow in time, like needle-work
and charity. A husband is like your appendix.
When you don’t know it’s there, it’s no use, and when
you do, it’s a nuisance.”</p>

<p>“Had any tea?” inquired Patricia of Image.</p>

<p>“No, will you take me and give me some?” They
walked together to the next room. “Dear me, would
you mind hobbling on your knees, or providing me with
stilts? After the miniature women of Japan you take
my breath away. The modern Englishwoman is really
a glorious creature.”</p>

<p>Pat laughed amiably. “I’m a sort of yard-measure,
aren’t I? It’s a nuisance really, except when you get in a
crowd. Mother winces every time she sees me, and
father says my feet are larger than his.”</p>

<p>But Image looked admiringly at her over the edge of
his tea-cup. To him this fine young girl, so amazingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
fresh and healthy, Saxon in colouring, with the limbs
of an athlete, was most attractive, though he knew she
made his own lack of inches more conspicuous.</p>

<p>“I suppose we shall have you getting married soon?”
he said, beaming on her through his glasses.</p>

<p>Patricia shrugged her broad shoulders and nibbled at
a sandwich. “Didn’t you hear Rhoda say that we women
are getting out of the habit?”</p>

<p>“She talks a lot of nonsense. Don’t listen to it. You
are much too fresh and sweet to repeat such horrible
cynicism.”</p>

<p>“We are all cynical nowadays. How is it you have
escaped? How have you managed to keep on believing
in people and things?”</p>

<p>Image answered quite simply and directly. “By loving
a woman, my dear. To love a woman well keeps the
core of a man’s heart from withering and getting old.
My blessings on all your sex, even a Rhoda Carnegie,
because of <em>her</em>.”</p>

<p>It was said so naturally that Patricia, who, like all
young things, recoiled from any display of sentiment,
could not find any fault with the frankness with which
he had replied to her question. She became a little
graver, and whether by accident or the prompting of
some hidden association of ideas, she glanced up at the
opposite wall, where hung a portrait of Gilbert, a
wedding-present from the tenants on his father’s estate.</p>

<p>“Ah!” she said impulsively, “but why, then, do so
many marriages go wrong? They seem so right beforehand,
and then——” She checked herself suddenly and
shot a sideways look at the little man beside her, like a
child who fears she has betrayed a cherished secret. But
though Image’s mind was full of alarm at what he felt
lay between the lines, he gave no sign that Pat could have
had any personal implication in her mind. To Pat’s
relief, Frank Hamilton came in for some tea, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
seized upon him and made him known to Carey Image.</p>

<p>“I am delighted to make your acquaintance,” said
Image, with his old-world formality. “I have heard
your praises sung, but never found myself in your
company before. I saw one of your portraits photographed
for an illustrated paper I found in Japan. I
understand you are engaged on a portrait of our hostess?”</p>

<p>Hamilton’s face, which had been full of pleased attention—Rhoda
said he swallowed praise as a baby swallows
milk—clouded a little. Then he replied with an
engaging air of frankness.</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth, I have not been successful so
far. She is a most difficult subject, though a delightful
one. I have already destroyed one portrait and several
studies. I think she is tired of my efforts, for I cannot
persuade her to come to the studio for sittings. And I
want <em>so much</em> to get a good portrait of her.”</p>

<p>Image nodded understandingly. “Yes, I should say
Mrs. Currey would be a difficult subject. Her greatest
charm is in her animation and spirit, and those qualities
are always difficult to transfer to canvas. And such
people always appear different to each of their friends,
so that a popular success is, I should say, almost impossible.
It is before the cow-like, plaster-of-paris
woman that people throw up their hands and say ‘How
like!’”</p>

<p>“I see you know something about the art of portrait-painting,”
said Hamilton, looking pleased.</p>

<p>“He knows something about everything,” exclaimed
Pat. “He’s a walking index and encyclopædia, a Who’s
Who and a Dictionary of National Biography all combined.”</p>

<p>Claudia came up and caught the last words.</p>

<p>“He’s nothing so dull and uninteresting. It’s a deadly
insult, godfather. Up, sir, and at Patricia.”</p>

<p>“How can I?” said Image humorously. “Just look at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
us! I shall have to get some of the mushroom that Alice
nibbled before I fight your sister.”</p>

<p>“Oh! but the pen is mightier than the sword! Annihilate
her with an epigram; that’s much more deadly,
because your enemies go round repeating it,” said Claudia
gaily. Image noticed that Hamilton was feasting his
eyes on her face and that Claudia seemed rather to avoid
looking at him. Image received the impression that she
was used to his homage and did not either actively encourage
or resent it.</p>

<p>“Such bad form,” jeered Pat. “Everyone epigrammates
nowadays, and you never have the least idea what
anyone is talking about. You answer in the same strain,
and you wonder what on earth you yourself are
talking about. Anyone can get a reputation for being
clever, if he’s only vague and wild enough in his conversation.”</p>

<p>In the general laugh at Patricia the group shifted, and
Image found himself alone with Claudia. She smiled
upon him frankly and said with obvious sincerity:</p>

<p>“It’s so nice to see you again. Don’t run away for
a while. By and by, I expect another friend back from
‘furrin parts abroad.’ You remember Colin Paton?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, yes, and shall be glad to see him again.”</p>

<p>“So shall I. He’s such an excellent and satisfying
companion. A ‘collectable’ person, you know. At least,”
she added, with a slight change of tone, “I used to find
him so.”</p>

<p>“That sounds a little like granny, with her ‘When I
was young, my dear, I used to——’”</p>

<p>Claudia laughed. “Oh well! friends change, even in
eighteen months, or else it is that one changes one’s self,
and friends seem different, judged by different standards.
Eighteen months may be a day—or an eternity. He went
away just before our wedding, you know. He has written
me some most delightful letters at intervals since. He is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
one of the few men who can write something more than
a telegram.”</p>

<p>Although he did not appear to be doing so, the keen
eyes of her companion were scrutinizing her face as she
talked. In middle-age or its borderland lines tell their
tale for all to read, massage she ever so assiduously, but
the changes in a young face are much more subtle and
difficult to classify. But to a student of physiognomy
like Carey Image there is sometimes a hint conveyed in
the softest curve, a suggestion in an apparently sunny
smile, a warning in the glance of brilliantly youthful eyes,
such as were now confronting him.</p>

<p>She was not satisfied, she was not happy. The eyes
had lost a little of the eager, questioning softness he had
noticed in the photograph in Gilbert’s room two years
ago, and the mouth had acquired a little more decisiveness
and an inclination toward sarcasm rather than smiles.
Her whole bearing was much more assured, much more
the woman of the world, the woman who has eaten of
the Tree of Knowledge. But Image knew that she had
not found that fruit altogether sweet. And he was profoundly
sorry. He would have been sorry to have read that
information on any young man or woman’s face for he
always wanted the world to be a more joyful place, but he
particularly liked his young hostess. He saw in Claudia
the bud that has blossomed but has never been warmed by
the good red sun, so that the petals at the heart are still
cold and unopened. And with the kindly wisdom of his
fifty-four years, Image knew that this spelt danger ahead.</p>

<p>They chatted on, Claudia questioning him about his
wanderings abroad, until they were interrupted by one
of the servants.</p>

<p>“The master has just rung up, madam, to say that he
cannot get back this evening in time to accompany you
out to Hampstead to-night, and will you please make his
apologies to Mrs. Rivington.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>Claudia listened with a curious compression of her lips,
like someone who listens with irritation to a too frequently
told tale. Then she made a quick movement
towards the door.</p>

<p>“I must speak to him myself. It’s too bad. Mrs.
Rivington——”</p>

<p>Then she stopped short, as though second thoughts
had put a check on her impulse. She came back to Image
with a resigned shrug of her shoulders.</p>

<p>“It really is too bad of Gilbert. I spend half my time
making apologies for him and meekly bearing the ill-temper
of my hostess whose table has been disarranged.”
Yet she looked anything but meek as she said it. “I am
sure people will soon cease to ask us, because it <em>is</em> annoying
to have your table upset at the last minute. It
would try the patience of a hostess in heaven. Mrs.
Rivington will be furious. She has asked us several times
and we’ve refused.... Oh, well! I must go and telephone
at once. That’s the only peace-offering and oblation I
can make.”</p>

<p>“Let me go, Claud,” said Patricia; “you can’t leave
your guests, and as she is a stranger to me, her wrath
will pass harmlessly over my head.”</p>

<p>Claudia accepted the offer with relief. “You’ll find
the number under Major-General Rivington, Newcombe
Avenue. I say, Pat, suggest that, as Gilbert can’t come,
I shall absent myself also.” Hopefully. “Perhaps she’ll
let me off, as they are Gilbert’s friends rather than mine.
Get me a reprieve if you can. It’s in the wilds of West
Hampstead, and it’s such a long drive for a bad
dinner.”</p>

<p>“Right-o! I’ll be a perfect Machiavelli on the telephone,”
sang out Pat as she departed.</p>

<p>Dr. Fritz Neeburg, who was sitting near by, looked up
as Pat went. “Is Gilbert in the habit of working in the
evening, Mrs Currey?” he asked quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, pretty often, Dr. Neeburg. Do you approve of
it? You are his doctor, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but he hasn’t been to see me for ages, so I
suppose he keeps pretty fit. All the same, I don’t approve
of it.”</p>

<p>“He’s looking very tired,” said Claudia lightly. “Last
night he did go out with me to a party at the ‘Ritz,’ but
he was too tired to talk. I am sure the woman who sat
next to him must be going about saying that the new
K.C. is the dullest man in London.”</p>

<p>“I must talk to him,” said Neeburg decidedly. “He’s
just the sort of a man who has a splendid constitution
and takes that as an excuse for overwork. When a man
gets into the habit of thinking of himself as a machine
Nature has a little way of avenging such slights.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Currey, give him a curtain lecture,” said Image.</p>

<p>Claudia’s lip curled a little and she raised her eyebrows.
“You can’t curtain-lecture a man who listens in silence
and then says, like putting in the cork, ‘You don’t understand.
Women never do. A man who wants to make
his way nowadays must devote himself whole-heartedly
to his work. The world is strewn with the wreckage of
men who have relaxed too soon or “taken holidays.”’”</p>

<p>Patricia has returned.</p>

<p>“Claudia, I did my best, and even spoke quite plainly;
but I couldn’t get you off. She was very cross indeed.
Her voice through the telephone was like that of an
angry mosquito. She says <em>you</em>, at least, must come, and
she wants you to bring a substitute. She suggested that
Mr. Hamilton should come out with you, as she wants
to make his acquaintance.”</p>

<p>Claudia spoke coldly. “I can’t ask Mr. Hamilton, or anyone,
to take Gilbert’s place at a couple of hours’ notice.”</p>

<p>“No, I told her that, but she seemed to think you
ought to get her out of the difficulty with the table.”</p>

<p>She did not tell her sister that Lorna Rivington’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
rather sharp reply had been, “Your sister and he are
such great friends that I am sure he would do it if she
asked him.” Instead she whispered in her sister’s ear,
“Why don’t you ask Mr. Image? He is such a nice,
obliging dear.”</p>

<p>Because her feelings were divided between an unreasonable
anger that Mrs. Rivington should make such a
suggestion and a pleasurable relief that her long drive
might not be so boresome after all, she seized on the
alternative suggestion.</p>

<p>“Mr. Image, you have heard of my dilemma. Would
you earn the martyr’s crown and take me out to Hampstead?
It’s too bad to ask you at such short notice,
but——”</p>

<p>“I should have been only too pleased,” returned Image,
with a note of sincere regret, “but it is the anniversary
of my mother’s death, and I always spend the evening
quite quietly. At any other time, if such a situation
occurs and I can fill the bill, ring me up and just give
me time to dress. But you must give me an hour—I
can’t do it in less.” It was well known that Carey Image
took an age to attire himself. His neat, precise personal
habits and leisurely methods of dressing were a constant
amusement to his friends and a handle to his—very few—enemies.</p>

<p>Several people came up to make their adieux, among
them Frank Hamilton.</p>

<p>“Why are you going so soon?” asked Claudia of him,
for he had lately slipped into the habit of outstaying other
visitors and waiting for a talk with her.</p>

<p>“I promised to go to Ealing to-night,” he said with
a self-pitying sigh.</p>

<p>“Ealing,” said Claudia vaguely. “Where is that?
Then it’s no good asking you to come out with me this
evening? My husband is detained at his chambers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
I want a substitute.” She was conscious of a slight
sense of disappointment, though she had fully made up
her mind a minute previously not to ask Hamilton.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” he said eagerly. “I can send a wire.”</p>

<p>“But your engagement?”</p>

<p>“Of no importance. I can easily go some other night.
Old friends.... If you will have me I am entirely at
your service.”</p>

<p>He looked into her eyes with his, over which he had
not troubled to draw the blinds of conventionality. They
underlined and emphasized the spoken words so that no
woman could fail to understand. And she felt a pleasing
sensation of power as she parried his devotion. She did
not acknowledge it to herself, but she was subtly aware
that they were both on the brink of deep waters. His
eyes had spoken words of love for many weeks. His
very <i lang="fr">naïveté</i> and boyishness had its attraction for her.
He was just as easy to move as Gilbert was difficult.
She could colour his thoughts, deflect his mind, bring
him instantly inside the circle of her mood. He took
his colour from her like a chameleon, and she did not
stop to consider whether she alone had this power, or
if Frank Hamilton were always so influenced by attractive
women.</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” she said, holding out her hand,
“You are bidden to take dinner at the house of one
Major-General Rivington, who served Her Majesty
Queen Victoria with great distinction, and is now resting
on his laurels in the wilds of West Hampstead. Come
for me at half-past seven.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">“LIVE! LIVE! LIVE!”</span></h3>

<p>Claudia did not belong to the tribe of unpunctual
women who stretch the minutes at their will and
snap derisive fingers at Greenwich. The person who was
unpunctual in their house was its master. That, however,
was not due to carelessness, but to his uncertain
calls. Often it was Claudia who, when the motor was at
the door, sat down in her cloak and waited for her
spouse.</p>

<p>So this evening she was ready in good time. It wanted
still a few minutes to the half-hour when she cast a last
critical look at herself in the mirror.</p>

<p>She was one of those women whom a <i lang="fr">décolleté</i> dress
shows at their best, and Claudia knew, as she surveyed
herself, that the result was good. She was as little conceited
as any of her sex—she had too much brain and
good looks for that; but she could not fail to see that the
gown she was wearing for the first time made her look
strikingly handsome in the best and most individual way.
It was as though the creator of the gown had loved his
task, for the deep orange of the rich yet light-weight
fabric, softened with some exquisite pearl-embroidered
lace and bordered on the skirt with dark-hued skunk,
threw up into relief the darkly-bronze lights in her hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and made the big brown eyes seem softer and deeper
than ever. A strange Oriental-looking headpiece studded
with topazes and pearls accentuated the foreign note in
her appearance, which so impressed strangers that they
refused to believe that she was entirely English as she
averred and believed. They said the way she moved
and wore her dresses was not English, that she could not
belong to the nation of women who know how to choose
a frock but not how to wear it. As she stood in front of
the mirror she was a flat contradiction to the American
who said that English men were dressed, but the women
only wore frocks.</p>

<p>Her looks had improved since her marriage. For some
unknown reason she scrutinized herself dispassionately
that night, and she realized that she was infinitely more
attractive to men than when Gilbert had married her.
Her figure now was almost as good as her mother’s had
been at her age. Indeed, the tops of her arms and her
wrists were even prettier. She remembered what an old
friend of her mother’s had once said to her just before
her marriage. “You will be much admired, my dear, and
you will remain naturally good-looking longer than
your mother has done. But you will never enslave all
sorts and conditions of men as she did—not that you
come so far below her in looks, but because hers is the
<i lang="fr">beauté du diable</i>, that irresistible magnet to unregenerate
man. You look too intelligent, too independent, too
critical. That will pique some here and there, but the
woman who shows obviously that she likes men and that
they are necessary to her always finds a return for that
compliment. Besides, she holds out hopes of reward
which your type does not. The majority of men are
childish and lazy: they pick the fruit on the lowest
branches. You would be too <i lang="fr">exigeante</i>, you would demand
more than they could give. Your nature is not
that of a Circe, and men will know it instinctively.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Then she had kissed her affectionately and added, “I
am glad you have no <i lang="fr">beauté du diable</i>. The world is
better without it. Take your place in the heart of one
man, not in the passions of many.”</p>

<p>Claudia thought over these words as she thoughtfully
pulled on her gloves. And simultaneously she recalled
a scene soon after Gilbert’s proposal when she had, as
to-night, stood in front of the mirror and slowly divesting
herself of her garments, half shyly, half exultingly, because
of her love of beauty, had watched the charms of
her body emerge. She had rejoiced in her own comeliness
because it was a gift she was bringing to her husband,
a wedding gift such as few women could present.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders at the recollection, and her
face hardened a little. She had learned how evanescent
a thing is passion with a man of Gilbert’s self-centred,
violent nature. And the knowledge rankled, so that as
she looked at herself something which was not the individual,
Claudia Currey, the wife of the new K.C., but
Women Unsatisfied and Disappointed, crept into her eyes
and mouth, and which, for the first time, gave her some
fleeting resemblance to her mother. Was her mother’s
old friend quite right? Was there no touch of the
devil’s beauty in her looks now? Perhaps she would
have changed her mind if she could have seen the woman
looking broodingly at her own reflection, a smouldering
defiance in her eyes, an unformed challenge on her lips.
That it was not the real Claudia that looked so, the
passionate-hearted, idealistic woman who walked away
with her head held high, the elder woman would have
known; but she would have had to acknowledge regretfully
that Claudia was evolving.</p>

<p>Then had she been present she would have seen the
little hardness disappear as morning mist before the sun,
as a familiar padding sound became evident along the
carpet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Only Billie, only a dog, but so unchangeably devoted,
so unceasingly responsive. In a sudden burst of thwarted
affection she caught him up, heedless of her costly embroideries,
and hugged his fat bundle of soft brown fur.
At least this creature loved her, she was his whole world
and——</p>

<p>“Mr. Hamilton, madam.”</p>

<p>Billie found himself gently deposited on the floor,
where he stood wagging his tail with pleasure at the
caress, yet eyeing her beseechingly, as he always did
when she was going out, as if to say, “Are you really
going to leave me again?”</p>

<p>“Tell Mr. Hamilton that I am quite ready. Is the fur
rug in the motor? It will be cold coming home to-night.”</p>

<p>She refastened a corsage spray that had been loosened,
and picked up an Eastern-looking garment of dull golds
and browns, with a chiffon and skunk muff that
matched. Outside it was freezing, and the trees in the
Park were lightly powdered with snow. Billie stood on
his short stumpy hind legs—a great effort by reason of
his plumpness—and besought her to stay with him.
Claudia laughed gently, and stooping down, took the little
useless, dangling paws in her hand.</p>

<p>“Billie, you fool, don’t you know how ridiculous it is;
to love anyone so much? Better far to cut your heart
up into lots of little pieces and distribute them than give
it away in a lump. Don’t you know that?”</p>

<p>No, Billie didn’t know that at all.</p>

<p>“Well, it is. Listen to my words of wisdom and ponder
them in your doggy understanding. It hurts, Billie boy,
to love very much, it hurts dreadfully, though you pretend,
except to a little dog who keeps your counsel, that
it doesn’t. Well, I shall never do it again, and it’s all
over, Billie; it’s all over, both the dream and the awakening....
Go to your basket and sleep the sleep of the
faithful.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>They drove some way in silence. Inside the motor it
was cosy and warm, in pleasant contrast to the streets,
for the snow that lingered still on the trees had turned
into slush on the pavements. The pedestrians looked
uncomfortable and nipped by the east wind which was
blowing, and the mud on the roads gleamed evilly in the
light of the street lamps. Here and there they passed
dirty heaps of snow in sheltered corners. Like the lace
petticoats of a fine lady once pure and spotless, it was
revolting now in its soiled, bedraggled state. People
waiting in the wind at street corners for buses looked
enviously at the motor as they passed. The padded
luxury in which the two were enveloped, the dim frosted
light, the narcissi in the silver holder diffusing a faint
perfume, were very <i lang="fr">intime</i> and aloof from the discomfort
abroad.</p>

<p>They had left Baker Street behind them before Claudia
came out of her reverie and realized that she was not
being sociable. She looked sideways at her companion,
to find him steadily regarding her.</p>

<p>“Are you wondering when I would be polite and talk?”
she said, with a smile.</p>

<p>“No.... I was making a mental picture of you. I
think—I think I can paint you now. I want to paint you
in that velvet cloak—what colour do you call it?—it is
like copper in the firelight—with the sable just touching
your throat at one side just as it is now and falling off
the other shoulder. Will you let me? Oh! I want my
brushes in my hand now.” His eyes suddenly blazed
with the inspiration of the moment as they devoured
her. Quickly she drew the folds of the cloak closer
around her neck. She felt as though a scorching wind
had swept over her, a sirocco of passion came from him
to her. She shrank back a little, yet even as she instinctively
did so she wondered why. Her husband flagrantly
neglected her, most of her friends had consoled themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
for their husbands’ shortcomings, and had not
she <em>almost</em> determined to seek the love which she craved
outside her home? She met his eyes, and she was half
attracted, half repelled by their light. She liked him, she
felt his magnetism drawing her, and yet something which
she could not quite understand bobbed quickly up to the
surface of her mind and surveyed them both with a
certain contempt. So she was a little cruel in her reply
to his enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“You were not very successful last time. I hope you
destroyed that picture.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I slashed it to pieces in the middle of the night,”
he said sombrely.</p>

<p>Claudia laughed lightly.</p>

<p>“Why in the middle of the night? Why were you
moved to be so melodramatic?” She often teased him
and made him angry by saying that he ought to have
been an actor. For Frank Hamilton had a torch of the
woman in him which clothed in drama many things that
he did and said. Whether he was conscious of these
effects or whether they came naturally to his character
Claudia could never determine.</p>

<p>“I had been dreaming of you,” he said simply. “I
had seen you standing at the foot of my bed, looking
down on me, and I knew exactly how I should have
painted you. So I sprang out of bed and hacked the
beastly canvas to pieces. Afterwards I made a rough
charcoal sketch of you from memory. To-night you look
as you did when you stood at the foot of my bed.” The
eyes of the man were audacious, but the words were
spoken very quietly.</p>

<p>“I beg to remark that my frock is brand new,” rejoined
Claudia flippantly. “I have never worn it even in dream-land.
It is hard to be deprived of a positively first appearance
when frocks are so ruinously expensive.”</p>

<p>“You looked wonderful that night,” he went on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
dreamily. “I have always seen you since—as you might
look.”</p>

<p>“As I <em>might</em> look,” she repeated, her curiosity getting
the better of her discretion. “What do you mean by
that?”</p>

<p>He was looking out at the glistening streets, at the
flakes of snow beginning to fall again, and he made no
reply. This piqued her the more, and she repeated her
question.</p>

<p>“I suppose you will be angry with me,” he said slowly.
“Women always resent these things. I don’t know why....
As you <em>might</em> look if you were not so proud and
if your brain did not rule your heart, if you would let
yourself be the woman—you were meant to be.”</p>

<p>Claudia wanted to say “How ridiculous!” but she
couldn’t. The motor was passing a large burial ground,
the tombstones showing by the railings like dreary grey
ghosts in the darkness, shut in with the wet, dripping
trees, and looking hungrily at life passing a few yards
away. Underneath those tombstones were hearts and
brains in silent decay that had once been men and women.
Claudia watched them flit by and she was silent now.
She wondered if those tombstones had a message for
her. Were not the dead saying “Live! live! live! Death
started out to meet as soon as you were born.”</p>

<p>The man beside her commenced to quote softly, almost
in a whisper:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Always I know how little severs me</div>
<div class="verse">From mine heart’s country, that is yet so far;</div>
<div class="verse">And I must lean and long across a bar</div>
<div class="verse">That half a word would shatter utterly.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Ah! might it be, that just by touch of hand</div>
<div class="verse">Or speaking silence, shall the barrier fall;</div>
<div class="verse">And she shall pass, with no vain words at all,</div>
<div class="verse">But droop into mine arms and understand.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>The motor came to a standstill, and Claudia shook
herself free from the spell of his words. There are few
men who can quote poetry without divesting it of all
lyrical charm and naturalness, but Frank Hamilton
knew or had acquired the art. Then, as though
the quotation were some nursery jingle, his voice
altered, and he said, “Heigh ho! is this the house? What
is my hostess like? Hints, please. I meant to have
asked you before.”</p>

<p>“Much younger than her husband, but not as young as
she would like to be,” whispered Claudia hurriedly. “If
you flatter her judiciously you may get a portrait out
of her. She is dying to have it painted.”</p>

<p>The boy was opening the door, but he caught her arm
with every appearance of sudden anger, and made her
stop and look at him.</p>

<p>“Do you think I only like to come out with you because
I may get commissions for portraits from your friends?”
he said heatedly. “Answer me, please.”</p>

<p>Claudia looked at the boy and motioned him to silence.
“Don’t be foolish, I was only jesting. You mustn’t be
so sensitive....” Then, as they walked up the steps
together she said smilingly, “If you say silly things like
that, you shan’t come out with me again. But, seriously,
Mrs. Rivington has been wanting to meet you for a long
time. I think she fancies that if she gets to know you
the portrait will come cheaper. But she is well able to
pay, so don’t take any notice when she hints at her
poverty of purse. She is a woman who would try and
get a discount off her seat in heaven.”</p>

<p>“You <em>will</em> make time to come to the studio one day
quite soon, won’t you?” he pleaded.</p>

<p>“I’ll see,” she said, as the door opened before them.</p>

<p>The maid came forward and slipped off her cloak. As
she waited and pulled up her gloves, Claudia propounded
a question to herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“He seems to care so much—I wonder if he is really
sincere.”</p>

<p>When a woman stands and asks that question, the
man has scored his first point. But Claudia thought the
tricks were still all in her hand.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">“ICH LIEBE DICH”</span></h3>

<p>To her surprise Claudia found that the assembled
company included her father and mother-in-law.
Mrs. Rivington’s set was absolutely antipodal to Lady
Currey’s, but as the General was an old friend of Sir
John’s Lady Currey occasionally and stiffly countenanced
the wife. Since her marriage, the intercourse between
Claudia and Gilbert’s family had been of the most formal
description, for Lady Currey found nothing to like
in Claudia, and her daughter-in-law realized that she
was taken on sufferance.</p>

<p>“So I shall not see my dear son to-night,” said the elder
woman, as she presented a frosty cheek for Claudia to
kiss. “It is a disappointment.” She looked with sideways
disapproval at Claudia’s toilette. “As showy as
her mother,” was her mental comment.</p>

<p>“You knew he was expected? He telephoned me at
the last minute that he was detained at his chambers.”</p>

<p>Lady Currey’s eyebrows were of the fixture kind that
cannot really be raised, only crumpled. She crumpled
them now.</p>

<p>“Ah! I remember when I was young no woman
thought of going out without her husband. If John did
not care to go to a function I stayed away. When he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
had that fall from his horse I never took a meal outside
the house for five months.”</p>

<p>Claudia would have explained to anyone else that her
hostess had insisted on her presence, and thus have
soothed down old-fashioned prejudices, but Lady Currey’s
tone annoyed her.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she said carelessly, “women are neither treated
as children nor inmates of a harem nowadays. We have
progressed, you know. Women are freeing themselves.
Did you never revolt in your heart of hearts?”</p>

<p>“My pleasure was always to do as my husband
wished.”</p>

<p>“What is that about me?” said Sir John, coming up
to them. “How do you do, Claudia. I am sorry Gilbert
is not able to come. But it shows the right spirit. I
inculcated that into him when he was a boy.”</p>

<p>He looked at Claudia fixedly under his heavy, bushy
eyebrows. They always annoyed Claudia, who longed to
tell him to brush them. She knew the meaning of that
look. It was to remind her that she had so far failed to
provide him with a grandson.</p>

<p>“Then the responsibility rests with you,” said Claudia
quietly.</p>

<p>“What do you mean? What responsibility? We are
proud of him.”</p>

<p>“‘All work and no play——’” Claudia began to
quote, when he interrupted her.</p>

<p>“Pooh! that was invented by some lazy rogue, I bet.
Work never yet hurt any man. It’s play—late hours, too
rich food and too much drink—that plays old Harry
with the constitution. I impressed that on him early in
life. Marian, don’t fidget with your fan”—she carried
an old-fashioned fan of black ostrich feathers—“it
worries me. The husband to work and the wife to look
after the house and the children, that is the proper division.
You leave Gilbert alone, and don’t worry him to
come to silly dinner-parties. I’m getting on in years, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
it doesn’t matter about me. He’s carrying the name to
the country. The youngest K.C.—it’ s a thing to be proud
of in a husband, Claudia.” He fixed his rather prominent
cold grey eyes on her as she lightly shrugged her
shoulders.</p>

<p>But her hostess fluttered up to her rescue. Mrs. Rivington
never walked like other people, she always floated
or fluttered.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Currey, may I present to you Mr. Littleton, who
will take you in to dinner. It was too bad of your husband
to desert us. But he is impervious to the charms
of women, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Obviously not,” said the tall, almost gaunt, fair-haired
man who bowed before her. Claudia knew by the accent
that he was an American. “Your husband is the new
K.C., is he not? King’s Counsel—it has a dignified but
archaic sound to our ears.”</p>

<p>“Don’t,” cried Mrs. Rivington shrilly, gauging in ten
seconds the probable cost of Claudia’s dress. “I’m an
Imperialist, and I wave flags and put up bunting and do
all sorts of loyal things, and the red on a Union Jack
doesn’t agree with my complexion, so I really am quite
genuine and what-you-may-call-it. Don’t run down the
King to me.” She fluttered off, her eyes roving restlessly
over the couples she was pairing.</p>

<p>Left together, Claudia and the American smiled. He
was the type of American that suggests the mettlesome
racehorse, lean-flanked, long-limbed, not a spare ounce of
flesh on his bones, relying on training and determination
to carry him through the race. He was unusually fair,
with a suggestion that he might have had a Viking ancestor,
yet there was nothing colourless about him.
Claudia wondered what he might be, millionaire, financier,
hoping to become one, railroad magnate, what? She
was sure he was a worker, it was written in every line of
him.</p>

<p>“I am certain women like our hostess are really and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
truly the props of your empire,” he said gravely. “The
sacrifice of a complexion, what can compare with it?
Sons, lands, money—what can touch it?”</p>

<p>They both laughed as they moved in to dinner. As
Claudia had predicted, Mrs. Rivington was spreading herself
over Frank Hamilton. Littleton caught the exchange
of glances between him and his partner, and
made a mental note. He was by way of studying Englishwomen.</p>

<p>“Are you here for long?” asked Claudia, unfolding
her serviette.</p>

<p>“Maybe I’ll be here for six months or so. I know you
are wondering what is my particular branch of money-making.
I’m a publisher—Littleton, Robins and Co., and
we’re starting a branch over here as an experiment. I
want to stay for a bit and direct it.”</p>

<p>Her interest was aroused. Everything to do with
books had a fascination for her ever since Colin Paton
had taught her to love them. And to her a publisher was
not a merchant, a mere purveyor of books to the public,
but something dedicated to the service of art. The
glamour of the books was around the man who produced
them. She knew of his firm as one that specialized in art
books and good <i lang="fr">belles lettres</i>. She had several books
with his imprint on her shelves. So the talk flowed on
smoothly after this happy opening, neither having to
consider what they should say next to while away the
dinner-hour. Claudia found herself more interested than
she had been for a long time at a dinner-table. He had
not the delicate illuminating touch of Colin Paton, he
lacked the subtleties of his imagination and sound classical
scholarship, but he knew all the books of the day
and was appreciative of the good in them.</p>

<p>Towards the end of dinner he looked at her with a
whimsical twinkle in his blue eyes and said, “I wonder
if you will be amused or annoyed if I tell you something.
I am not sure how an Englishwoman takes such things.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Personally I think the photograph of a beautiful woman
should be public property, but I realize she may not.”</p>

<p>Claudia turned a wondering face upon him.</p>

<p>“Your photograph, in the shape of a coloured book-cover,
has gone into every part of the United States,
although”—with an appraisingly admiring glance—“the
artist did not get your colouring correctly. He made
your hair dead black and your skin and colouring too
pink and commonplace.”</p>

<p>“But how——”</p>

<p>“It was like this. We were publishing a new book of
Henry Roxton Vanderling’s—you know him—and we
wanted an attractive paper cover with a portrait of the
heroine. I remember it was a very hot day when we
were discussing the matter, and I told the artist I wanted
something specially taking. I generally have the English
illustrated papers sent out to me, and he was listlessly
turning over the pages, when he struck your photograph.
With a cry of ‘Here it is—bully!’ he nabbed it. A few
days later he brought me a coloured sketch suggested by
your portrait. I have the original sketch framed in my
office. Are you offended?”</p>

<p>Claudia laughed. It struck her as being humorous and
something unusual in the way of introductions. And she
was pleasantly aware, as any woman would be, of the
compliment conveyed.</p>

<p>“I knew you the minute you came into the room, although
I had forgotten your name. When you came in
I said to myself, ‘Vanderling’s “Woman of the East!”’
I felt somehow we were already acquainted.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think I ought to have a copy of the book.”
said Claudia promptly.</p>

<p>“Sure. I’ll send you one to-morrow. I’m delighted
you are amused, not angry. I took a big chance in telling
you, but I had to.”</p>

<p>“You thought I’d find out and you’d better put the
thing nicely, with the varnished side uppermost?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>He gave a hearty laugh. “Well, you’ve guessed most
of the truth. Mrs. Rivington spotted the resemblance,
and as I come from the same country as George Washington,
I didn’t tell a lie.”</p>

<p>“No, it’s no good telling a lie when it is sure to be
found out. Only a good lie justifies the liar.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Rivington was collecting eyes by this time, and
Claudia rose. In the drawing-room, an apartment so
crowded with furniture and bric-à-brac of various periods
that it suggested a well-dusted shop in Wardour Street,
her hostess seized on her.</p>

<p>“I was glad to see you getting on so well with Mr.
Littleton. He wanted to meet you. He told you about
the ‘Woman of the East’? Quite romantic, I think. He
ought to fall in love with you.”</p>

<p>“To serve as an advertisement is hardly romantic,
surely? I rank with the monkey advertising soap and
a starved cat extolling a certain milk.”</p>

<p>“Oh! how funny you are—and so cold and critical!
Now I should be thrilled. But you’re not a bit romantic,
anyone can see that. Oh! Claudia, is it true about your
brother?”</p>

<p>“My brother? What is it?” She wished Mrs. Rivington’s
eyes would not wander so restlessly over her person.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you know? They say he has married ‘The
Girlie Girl!’”</p>

<p>“Who on earth is ‘The Girlie Girl’?” laughed Claudia,
sipping her liqueur. “It sounds like a cross between a
barrel organ and a seaside pier.”</p>

<p>“Yes, doesn’t it? But don’t you know her—haven’t
you seen her picture on the hoardings? She was playing
at the Pavilion last week. I don’t like her style myself,
but I suppose most men would think her pretty. Not, of
course, that you can tell. Paint goes such a long way,
doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“A music-hall artiste? What an absurd rumour!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you sure it’s a rumour?” said her hostess, with a
gleam of malice. “These girls are always entrapping rich
young men, and I heard as a positive fact that the wedding
took place at the registrar’s three weeks ago.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense. Jack amuses himself, but he wouldn’t do
a thing like that. He’s an awful fool, but not such a
fool as that.”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Mrs. Rivington, dabbing at her nose
with a powder-puff; “I hope it’s not true, for your sake.
Fancy having a sister who calls herself ‘The Girlie Girl’!
Too awful to contemplate, isn’t it? Thank goodness,
I haven’t any children. I shouldn’t survive such a thing.
I don’t believe in marrying out of your own class.” As
the General had obviously married beneath him—it was
rumoured that she had been employed as reception-clerk
at an hotel—her scruples were understandable. “She
figures on the hoardings in a sort of <i lang="fr">vivandière</i> costume,
and the men seem to admire her no end. But men always
do admire such creatures. But really, Claudia, I am
afraid it is true. My sewing-maid knows one of her maids,
and this girl told Bertha in confidence that she went to
the registrar’s with them, only nobody is to know at
present. She heard all about the wedding-breakfast and
the gallons of champagne and the flowers. These people
live on champagne, I believe.”</p>

<p>Claudia, though a little startled, hardly credited the
story. At one time she had been afraid that Jack would
make some horrible <i lang="fr">mésalliance</i>, but as the years had gone
on and he had left the impressionable, callow stage behind
him, she had ceased to feel any alarm. Jack was an ass,
but he was a conventional ass. Once she hinted her
fears to him, but he had taken the suggestion as such a
deadly insult that she believed he realized the foolishness
of such things. She remembered that he had proudly
informed her that in the circle of “little ladies” he was
nicknamed “The Knowing Kard,” and he gave her to
understand that the nickname was not undeserved. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
now and then the family asked him when he was going
to settle down and espouse some well-born, inexperienced
girl, but Jack invariably said airily that there was lots of
time, and that a really nice wife would hamper a fellow
horribly, and a third party was always such a nuisance.
It was exceedingly unlikely that there was any foundation
for Mrs. Rivington’s piece of gossip. Claudia dismissed
the idea with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Jack has a large heart, if somewhat shallow,” she
said lightly. “I don’t think I’ll worry about his wedding-present.”</p>

<p>“Strange fascination these creatures have for men,”
commented her hostess, glancing round to see that the
other women were occupied. “Never can understand it
myself. How a man can fall in love with powder—several
inches thick—and grease paint beats me. But
men are so easily taken in, aren’t they? and of course we
should be too proud to use their arts.”</p>

<p>Claudia’s attention was wandering and her eyes were
caught by a woman of about thirty-five, rather badly
dressed, who did not seem to belong to the same <i lang="fr">galère</i> as
the other women. She was sitting apart, looking shy and
a little uncomfortable. No one seemed to be paying any
attention to her. Claudia wondered who she could be.
She had fine, expressive eyes and a sensitive mouth, and
she could have been much better-looking had she been
more fashionably dressed. Mrs. Rivington noticed the
direction of her eyes.</p>

<p>“I do wish Mrs. Milton would look smarter,” she said
rather irritably. “I hate réchaufféd dresses, don’t you?
But she’s got a beautiful voice, and I thought she would
amuse us after dinner. She and her husband are as poor
as church mice. She can’t get any engagements. Partly
her dowdy dresses, I should think.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean you have engaged her for the evening?”
asked Claudia.</p>

<p>“Heavens, no! I give her a dinner in return for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
music. She wants to get known. It’s really doing her
a kindness. I must go and talk to your mother-in-law
now. She hates me, but I can see everyone else is tired
of her. Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“I am going to talk to Mrs. Milton.” Claudia could
not stand the sight of the solitary figure any longer, and
she longed to tell her hostess what she thought of the
practice of getting artistes to give their services for nothing.
Colin Paton had opened her eyes to the injustice.
She was filled with shame for the set which she represented,
and she gave Mrs. Milton her most cordial smile—it
could be very charming—as she sat down beside her.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Rivington tells me that you sing beautifully,”
she said. “I am looking forward to hearing you. One
so seldom hears music nowadays after dinner. It is
usually that tiresome bridge.”</p>

<p>The woman flushed with pleasure; she had a fine skin
that coloured easily. They were the first friendly words
that had been addressed to her that evening, for she had
been taken in to dinner by a deaf old major.</p>

<p>“How nice of you,” she said involuntarily. She had
been admiring Claudia all the evening. “I do hope I am
in good voice, but my little boy has an attack of bronchitis
and I was up with him most of the night. And
when you are a little tired——”</p>

<p>Claudia nodded sympathetically. “I know. It takes all
the fullness and timbre out of the voice, doesn’t it? Must
you nurse your little boy yourself?” She noticed that the
singer’s voice was infinitely more refined than that of her
hostess, which had an unmistakable Cockney twang.</p>

<p>“Yes, we can’t afford a nurse,” said Mrs. Milton
simply. “You see, my husband lost all his money two
years ago. That’s why I come out to sing. When we
were married I gave it up to please him, but now I want
to help keep the house going.” The kind and real interest
in Claudia’s eyes warmed her to unwonted loquacity.</p>

<p>“And you have a little boy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have three children, two boys and a girl. They
are such darlings.” Her eyes lit up and the whole face
was transformed to something almost beautiful in its
brooding motherliness. “The boys are just like my husband,
so plucky and good-tempered. Oh! they are worth
fighting for. We say that every night when we tip-toe
into their room and see they are all right for the night.
Children make all the difference, don’t they?”</p>

<p>“I—I suppose they do.” Claudia could visualize the
picture of the man and woman, tired and anxious, looking
with love and hope at their sleeping children and
feeling that they made all the difference. She looked
across at the chattering groups scattered about the room,
most of the women, like her hostess, childless or having
only one child. Scraps of their conversation punctuated
Mrs. Milton’s words. “I assure you, Kitty, she lost
eighty pounds in two rubbers, and everyone knows she
can’t afford it. Who pays her debts? I should like to
know, and....” “Her bill, my dear, was outrageous.
She charged me twenty-two guineas for that little muslin
frock, and then....” “—entirely new method of treating
the complexion. No creams, only massage with....”</p>

<p>“You have none yet?” said Mrs. Milton gently.</p>

<p>“No ... but a husband counts also, doesn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! Rob is the best husband in the world.
Perhaps I love the boys so much because they are like
him. He hates my having to sing again. You know how
a man feels when his wife has to work, and he hoped to
give me an easy time. But he’s working in the City all
day, and I’d like to do something too. Oh, yes! Rob is
splendid. I should think he <em>did</em> count.” A woman’s
voice broke in shrilly: “I simply adore my dogs.
Wouldn’t be parted from them. Don’t enjoy my meals
unless they are with me and....”</p>

<p>Claudia and Mrs. Milton looked at one another, and the
mother-woman smiled. “Isn’t it a pity?” she said.</p>

<p>“Tell me where you live,” responded Claudia. “I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
want someone to sing at a little dinner I am giving soon.
I will not encourage these dull bridge evenings. Will you
sing for me?... Ah! here come the men.”</p>

<p>Frank Hamilton came straight across to her and commenced
to talk, apparently not noticing her companion,
who drew a little away, as though feeling she was not
wanted any longer. But Claudia interrupted Hamilton’s
rather ardent words and said, “Mrs. Milton, was Mr.
Hamilton introduced to you?” He was forced to turn
a little, and Claudia noticed that Mrs. Milton bowed with
a little embarrassment.</p>

<p>“I think Mr. Hamilton has forgotten me,” she replied
quietly. “We were acquainted in our youth.”</p>

<p>“Were you?” Claudia looked at him in surprise, for
she had been watching him all the evening out of the
corner of her eyes, while apparently oblivious of his
existence—a womanish trick—and she had not seen him
speak to her. When Hamilton spoke it was rather stiffly.</p>

<p>“I did not see you before, Mrs. Milton.” It was a
stupid fib, and Claudia noted it. “How do you do?
Yes, in our salad days we used to warble duets together,
didn’t we?” The geniality of the last words was rather
forced. Claudia divined that he did not want those days
recalled. The obvious reason momentarily occurred to
her, but a glance at Mrs. Milton dissipated it. Also, she
was several years older than Hamilton. Hamilton had
once confessed that he could never fall in love with a
plain woman, and Margaret Milton would never be beautiful
except to the man who loved her.</p>

<p>“I had hoped I should sit next to you,” he said in an
undertone. Mrs. Milton had moved away to the piano.
“It was too bad, and I couldn’t even see you properly
because of that beastly erection in the middle.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you were quite happy. You seemed to get on
quite well with your hostess. Who was that dark-complexioned
lady next to you, with some truly wonderful
diamonds?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mrs. Jacobs, the wife of a South African millionaire.
She told me that herself and that she was a widow!”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! Do we want to sit for a dusky portrait?”</p>

<p>“Don’t....” He tried to look very hurt, but it was
not so successful as earlier in the evening. The dinner
had been quite good and the champagne better. Hamilton’s
eyes were a little too bright to look very grieved.</p>

<p>“Did she not give you a commission?”</p>

<p>“Well, what if she did? Why do you always sneer at
me. And it’s <em>your</em> portrait I want to paint. What do I
care for her commission, even if it is a lucrative one.
Parchment and diamonds—ugh! Tell me, when will you
come again to the studio?”</p>

<p>“Hush, Mrs. Milton is going to sing. You must remain
absolutely quiet.”</p>

<p>The first notes of Brahms’ “<cite lang="de">Sapphische Ode</cite>” throbbed
through the inharmonious room. Margaret Milton had
the deep, pure contralto that makes the listener think of
all things tender and true and intimate, the things that no
man or woman says, even to his twin soul, but sometimes
in the watches of the night whispers to the shadows. And
the shadows enfold them and carry them away into the
Hinterland beyond the setting of the sun, with the poignant
tears and the imperishable kisses, the pain and the
joy and the passion of mortals.</p>

<p>The timbre of the voice was singularly sympathetic and
emotional, and Claudia instantly fell under its enchantment.
Somehow she felt that the woman was singing to
<em>her</em>, guiding her, pleading with her. She sang several
times, and then, after “<cite lang="de">Still wie die Nacht</cite>” by Claudia’s
request, she began to sing a song that always made
Claudia’s heart throb and ache intolerably. Her throat
swelled and burned on this night, and the tears waited
on her eyelids. She forgot the indifferent, politely bored
company, as she listened to the exquisite strains of that
wonderful love-song, “<cite lang="de">Ich liebe dich</cite>.”</p>

<p>And this plain, dowdy woman knew the real meaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
of that song. Only a woman who knew the joy and the
pain of love could have sung it as she sang it. The cry
of love rang through the room like a clear clarion call.
Even the people who had wanted to play bridge felt it
and looked vaguely uncomfortable. For a moment they
were lured from their money-bags. The call was so clear
that it penetrated the cotton-wool of everyday life.</p>

<p>Claudia found herself looking at the shabby woman at
the piano with fierce envy. Once, she, Claudia, had
thought she <em>knew</em>, once her heart had triumphantly
chanted “<i lang="de">Ich liebe dich, ich liebe dich</i>,” like an eternal
refrain. Once? Was it all quite over? Something stirred
within her, something touched her cold heart like the
rosy finger of hope. Once! Perhaps she and Gilbert had
only drifted apart, perhaps she had not made due allowances
for the inarticulate, more prosaic, unemotional nature
of man. She had loved him very much—she did
love him still, if only——</p>

<p>There was a bowl of red roses at her elbow. She did
not notice them, but perhaps it was their perfume that
mounted to her brain and brought back the remembrance
just then of the garden at Wargrave, when she had
questioned Gilbert and asked him if he had really loved
her.... He had promised she should always come first
... she was right to demand that ... he had said that
he was not good at pretty speeches and that she must
take some things for granted ... that men were different
from women.... Her blood tingled in her veins as she
felt in imagination again the fierce pressure of his arms
around her, his kisses on her lips. Surely he had really
loved her then, she reiterated to herself. She knew more
now than she did then. She had been initiated into the
mysteries of life and death. She had begun to realize
how large a part mere animal passion plays in a man’s
life, how men take love (so called) where they find it,
how “the worldly hopes men set their hearts upon” cheat
women of their just dues, and leave them bankrupt. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
with the passionate echo of “<i lang="de">Ich liebe dich</i>” in her ears,
she felt she could not write that horrible word “finis” to
this page of her life. Perhaps she had been too <i lang="fr">exigeante</i>,
impatient; perhaps she could be more tactful now. Eighteen
months! Why, it must be that she had not had
time to master the game of love. Their tastes were so
different, perhaps that was partly the trouble. She remembered
how he had talked her out of going to the enchanted
Palace at Como and substituted a golfing honeymoon
in Scotland. But he had been very charming to
her—humoring all her fancies, his own having been satisfied—he
had made her feel that she had only to command
and he would always obey love’s call. It had been an
intoxication. Was it all behind her? Was love behind
her for the rest of her life? No, she could not do without
love. She had always wanted it, she had tasted its
sweets, no, no, no! Gilbert must love her again as he
used to. He could not have entirely changed in eighteen
months. He was at home probably. Perhaps he was
thinking of her, wanting her to come in——</p>

<p>She rose abruptly to her feet, filled with an uncontrollable
blind desire for action, to pursue this elusive
thing which seemed to have escaped from her hands.</p>

<p>But Hamilton’s eyes fixed on her in surprise at her
abrupt rising, drew her back to earth and the faded
Aubusson carpet on which she stood. He, too, had been
moved by the music. His artistic pulses, so easily set
beating, had responded to the call also. But his thoughts
had been of the rather capricious woman by his side, the
woman who so far had never listened to his words of
love.</p>

<p>After his first surprise at her action, he came to the
flattering conclusion that the music had warmed her heart
towards him. An easy favourite with women, he did not
doubt that she cared for him. He had always gained
what he wanted, though he had never before aimed at
such big game as Claudia Currey. But he was rapidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
becoming famous, he was sought after and flattered.
Women begged him to paint them on his own terms.
He was not what he had been. Mrs. Milton knew what
he had been. Perhaps the game was not so difficult as
he had begun to fear. He looked at her meaningly, with
a rising sense of power, but she did not return his glance.
That might be shyness.</p>

<p>He heard her make her adieux to their hostess, who
protested at her going so early.</p>

<p>“It is only eleven o’clock.... I suppose you are
going on somewhere else, you and”—markedly—“Mr.
Hamilton.”</p>

<p>But her mother-in-law came to her rescue. “Claudia is
quite right. I daresay Gilbert wants her. I know John
is always fidgety when I am away from him.”</p>

<p>Claudia did not laugh as she would have done half an
hour previously. Perhaps Gilbert <em>was</em> wanting her. She
wanted him to want her.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hamilton, you need not see me home. I can——”</p>

<p>“Of course I am coming. Good-bye, Mrs. Rivington,
it has been a delightful evening. Yes, I won’t forget
about the portrait, Mrs. Jacobs.”</p>

<p>He followed Claudia out into the hall, followed by Mrs.
Milton with her roll of music.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know I should come?” he whispered, not
noticing her.</p>

<p>The maid helped Claudia on with her cloak. Mrs.
Milton was tucking herself—the maid, with the strange
knowledge of the servants’ hall, did not trouble to help
her—into a businesslike garment, long and warm. Claudia
heard her make some inquiry of one of the maids, and
caught the words “last ’bus.”</p>

<p>Frank came up to her at that moment, the dawning
light of possession in his eyes, a subtle change in his
manner.</p>

<p>“Are you ready, madam?” He smiled to himself as he
foresaw the long drive in the darkness, side by side in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the pleasant intimate warmth of the motor ... her hand
would fall naturally into his and then....</p>

<p>“Mrs. Milton, can I not give you a lift in the motor?”
Her clear voice cut short his dreams. “Where do you
live? Maida Vale. Oh! we can go that way quite easily.
Yes, I should like to take you home quickly to the bronchitisy
child.”</p>

<p>Only one of the maids, who giggled over it and
mimicked him directly the hall-door was shut, saw the
sudden scowl on Hamilton’s brow, for Claudia was bent
on saving the tired woman an uncomfortable cold journey
in the ’bus and Mrs. Milton was full of gratitude at the
unexpected thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>“My! wasn’t that a sell for him,” said the pert parlour-maid.
“Thought he’d have a nice, cosy time with her
all alone. But she wasn’t taking any. Always does a
man good to take him down a peg or two!”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">“NOT SATISFIED”</span></h3>

<p>As Claudia was waiting for the lift in their block of
flats half an hour later Fritz Neeburg came running
down the stairs.</p>

<p>“Ah! Mrs. Currey, you’re back early from your dinner-party.”
Claudia was a little impatient of Fritz Neeburg
because of a certain German stolidity and lack of imagination,
but he was what she called “a learned beast,” and a
very loyal and kindly friend to both of them. He had
lately given up practising as a medical man and devoted
himself to research work in connection with nervous
troubles affecting the brain.</p>

<p>“Dinner-parties have such a family resemblance,
haven’t they? I was bored.”</p>

<p>He nodded, noting the brilliancy of her eyes and wondering
what had caused the excitement in their depths.
She looked more highly strung than usual to-night, but it
seemed a happy excitement. It might have been the
anticipative joy of a woman going to her lover.</p>

<p>“Gilbert and I had some dinner—rather late—and we’ve
been yarning ever since.”</p>

<p>Claudia raised her eyebrows. “I thought Gilbert was
detained at his chambers.”</p>

<p>Neeburg caught a glint in her eyes that made him apprehensive
that he had said the wrong thing. “Oh!” he
added hastily, “it was nearly nine before he rang me up.
As it happened I was also late and hadn’t fed.”</p>

<p>Claudia’s lips curved into a smile, a smile that puzzled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
him. It <em>was</em> a smile, the lips had even parted, showing
her rather small white teeth, but he felt that it was the
wrong kind of smile. It seemed to have an edge to it
somehow. He wondered if he had put his foot in it as
he watched her ascend in the lift. Gilbert had told him
that he had “got out of a stupid dinner-party ... a
woman likes those sort of things ... her province, you
know....” Fritz Neeburg was a bachelor and knew
little of women, either by experience or temperament,
but he realized that it was not a real smile of genuine
amusement. He felt vaguely that it was like the
early bloom of a peach which masks the hidden acidity.
Then he recalled that Claudia lately had not been half so
gay and spontaneously happy as in the early months of
her marriage.</p>

<p>Gilbert came out of the study at the sound of her
entrance. She saw at once that he was in a good temper
and unusually genial. He was in the humour to stay up a
little longer and chat, for he had just worsted Fritz in an
argument over the Home Rule Bill, and Gilbert always
liked to hold his own, even on his own hearthrug.</p>

<p>“Hallo, Claudia! you’re back then. There’s a nice fire
in here. Pretty cold outside, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>She followed him into the library without any reply,
but he did not notice her silence, nor did he look at her,
except casually. He was a man who would buy a beautiful
picture, look admiringly at it once, hang it on his
walls and then never notice it again.</p>

<p>A big leather chair invited her to sit down, but she
stood by the oaken mantelpiece. Gilbert had commenced
to put away several reference books that he had got out
to convince Neeburg, for Gilbert was always great on
figures and statistics.</p>

<p>“Tough fighter, old Fritz, but of course you can’t expect
a German, even if he has lived over here all his life,
to understand English politics. Of course, he knows his
own subjects and——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>“Gilbert, you and Neeburg dined together to-night?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, faintly surprised. “Did you see him?”
For the moment he had forgotten his broken engagement
with the Rivingtons. He had a wonderful habit, which
had helped to make him what he was, of settling a point
and then automatically forgetting all about it. Then
his wife’s toilette caught his eye and he remembered.
Where had Claudia been? Oh, yes! “It would have
been an awful rush to have got back in time to dress
and go out to Hampstead, and I didn’t feel a bit like it.
How is the old General?”</p>

<p>His back was towards her, busy with the bookcase.
She looked at it coldly, critically.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you have made a little effort in order that
I shouldn’t have had to go all that way alone?” She
herself made a great one to speak calmly and pleasantly.
The echoes of <i lang="de">Ich liebe dich</i> were still faintly in her ears,
and if he would only turn and take her in his arms, and
say, “Look, old girl, I’m sorry. I know I’m a social
shirker, but I forgot you would have to go alone,” she
was ready to return the pressure of his arms. Women
can exist on very little love, very few caresses from the
man they care for, and Claudia was in the mood to make
every allowance for him.</p>

<p>He answered her rather mechanically, trying to find
the correct place for the volume.</p>

<p>“Oh, well! you like dinner-parties, and it’s not so far
in the motor. It’s not the day of the horse-brougham....
You are my social shop-window, and”—with blunt
humour—“it’s very nicely dressed. I wonder where that
book of Burke’s has got to? Besides I wanted to get
hold of Fritz, I wanted his opinion on a case.”</p>

<p>“You particularly asked me to accept this invitation
as the General is an old friend of <em>your</em> family.”</p>

<p>“Well, it does just as well if you go,” he said imperturbably,
mixing himself a whiskey and soda. “They
understand how busy I am.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“Suppose—I don’t understand.” Her lips were compressed
until the soft curves had disappeared, and the
determination and independence of the chin were emphasized.
He looked up from the syphon in surprise at
her tone.</p>

<p>“Were they awfully annoyed at my not turning up?
I suppose Mrs. Rivington scratched a little.”</p>

<p>“I am not concerned with the Rivingtons. I am talking
of myself, of my feelings on the subject.” She was
beginning to speak a little more quickly now. The cold,
abstracted look in his eyes stung her. He could not even
realize that she was hurt and angry. “I am not here
merely as your social shop-window, as you call it. I
am not here merely as your <i lang="de">hausfrau</i>, to order your food
and entertain and visit your friends. That is the way
in which you have lately been regarding me.... Do you
realize how often I have to go out in the evening alone?”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, but my work——”</p>

<p>“You could have got away quite easily to-night. I’m
not a fool, Gilbert, don’t underrate my intelligence. If
you had said to me in the first place, ‘Tell the Rivingtons
we are engaged for that day,’ and then spent the evening
quietly at home with me, I should have been perfectly
content. But I will not be used.”</p>

<p>“My dear girl——”</p>

<p>Perhaps there is nothing an angry woman dislikes
more at certain stages of an argument than that preface.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you even have come out to fetch me?” she
went on. “You see hardly anything of me, and we might
have had a good talk on the way home. Don’t you want
to see anything of me?”</p>

<p>“Why of course. Come, Claudia, do be reasonable.
We are having a talk now, and it might be a pleasant one,
if you are not so fiery. You are always getting so excited
over things.”</p>

<p>“I came home early because——” She remembered
the impulse that had made her leave the company, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
she laughed. Love? Was love this cold, indifferent,
methodical thing? Was she to be content with this tantalizing
imitation? Her eyes flashed defiantly and she
flung back her head. Picking up a cigarette out of the
box, she sat down and lighted it. Her excitement had
suddenly evaporated in that laugh like an exhaust-valve
relieving steam pressure. It was the rather critical repressed
woman of the world who next spoke to him.</p>

<p>“We don’t see much of one another nowadays, do we?”
she said, looking at him through the smoke.</p>

<p>“Later on I shall have more time, I hope,” he replied,
placidly accepting her cessation of unreasonableness. He
never worried over women’s moods. If you left them
alone, he argued, they evaporated.</p>

<p>“Later on, we shall both be middle-aged,” said Claudia
calmly. “Later on the gods will jeer at us and ask us
what we have done with our youth. They always ask
that question sooner or later of everyone. They always
bring you to account, and sometimes the balance is on one
side and sometimes on the other. I wonder how you
and I will be able to answer that question?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m not going to get old yet,” he smiled. “Anyone
would think we were on the verge of decrepitude.”</p>

<p>“I am not sure you have ever been young.” She
leaned her chin on her hand and looked at him. Somehow
the face of Frank Hamilton ranged itself beside it
to-night. A weaker face, yes, but it seemed to her that
there was real youth in the passionate eyes, real sentiment
in his deep voice, a <i lang="fr">joie de vivre</i> in his whole being which
called to her like the gleam of snow to the Arctic explorer.
Was it the strong men of the world who made
women happy? Was not the strong man always self-centered,
egoistic, taking all and giving nothing? Should
a woman ask for too much strength in the man she
loved?</p>

<p>Gilbert listened to her indulgently. It was just one of
Claudia’s odd moods. His marriage had been quite successful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and therefore so had hers. He knew that she
was very popular and that invitations to their house were
eagerly coveted. After what his mother said, he would
have hated that the marriage should have been a failure,
and he had accepted as fuel to his pride his mother’s
remark after a dinner-party which they had given and at
which Claudia had entertained the Prime Minister, the
Lord Chief Justice and other well-known people. “Claudia
makes an excellent hostess. After all, there is something
to be said for your marriage. The Iversons have always
had plenty of <i lang="fr">savoir faire</i>.” It was said a little grudgingly,
for Lady Currey still did not like Claudia. There
was nothing to disapprove of so far, but she was always
waiting for something.</p>

<p>“I am not sure that you ever were young,” repeated
Claudia. “I don’t believe you ever had a freakish, irresponsible
mood. I remember Pat saying once, on a beautiful
spring morning, that it made her feel as if she’d
like to turn somersaults on the grass and yell like a wild
Indian every time she came right side up! You never
felt like that, did you?”</p>

<p>“But I’m neither a wild Indian nor a dog,” said Gilbert,
trying to stifle a yawn. He had felt stimulated
while arguing with Neeburg, and had forgotten he was
tired. Now the yawns were threatening to descend upon
him and he began to feel drowsy. But a glance at Claudia
showed him that she was wide awake. She had what
her brother called “her brainy look.”</p>

<p>He had resolutely tried to ignore Claudia’s changing
and complex moods from the very beginning of their
married life. On their honeymoon he had stopped her
speculations and questions with kisses. His treatment
was clearly right. Claudia had been far less imaginative
and introspective in her talk lately. This idea of trying
to understand women was all nonsense. He had unconsciously
shaped his treatment of women on some words
of his father’s <i lang="fr">à propos</i> of some news he once brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
him about a neighbour’s wife who had eloped with another
man on the plea that her husband did not “understand
her.” “He’s well rid of her,” said his father contemptuously.
“There’s nothing to understand in women.
Don’t be misled by any of this modern novelist’s jargon,
my boy. Women always have suffered from the megrims,
and they always will. In one century they are called the
‘vapours,’ in another ‘moods,’ but they are megrims all
the same, caused by physical weakness and disabilities
and lack of self-control. More harm has been done by
humouring women and taking their megrims seriously
than will ever be known. It’s responsible for this ‘Votes
for Women’ movement, and, mark my words, if women
are not kept in their proper place, megrims may ruin the
nation!”</p>

<p>“After all,” said Gilbert, “it depends on what you mean
by youth. I suppose the dictionary would define it as
the state of being young, but it is conceivable that one
might improve on that. I was once in the state of being
young, you know, because my mother has some of my
first teeth!”</p>

<p>Claudia pondered a minute, twisting an old French
marquise ring round and round her little finger. “I
should think,” she said slowly, “it’s the ability to notice
and enjoy all the pleasures of the wayside. Yes, that’s
somewhere near it. The man who enjoys life is the one
who saunters along, admiring the flowers in the hedgerows,
sniffing the different perfumes, watching the insects
and the birds, filling his lungs with the good fresh air. The
man who doesn’t know how to enjoy life is the one who
rushes across country in the fastest touring car he can
buy.”</p>

<p>Gilbert rose and looked at the clock. “Lots of weeds
and undesirable tramps by the wayside,” he responded
dryly.</p>

<p>“Weeds and tramps are part of life. To enjoy every
minute of life you must waste a few.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I wish I had a chance to waste some.... Bed,
Claudia. I am sure no one would ever think you missed
your beauty-sleep, but I fear you often do.” He turned
towards the door, but she recalled him.</p>

<p>“Gilbert!”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“Are we always going to live like this? This is the
first opportunity we have had for a talk for—oh! weeks!
When we have people here, you always fall into bed the
moment the last guest goes; when we do go out together
we just have a few minutes in the car on the way home.
Gilbert, I——” Having got so far she hesitated and cast
a quick, appealing look at him. He came a little nearer.</p>

<p>“Is there anything you particularly want to say to
me?” he said, uncomprehending, but noticing the convulsive
rise and fall of her white bosom under its laces
and pearls. What had upset her?</p>

<p>“Gilbert, other men find me attractive ... other men
like my company ... you realize that, don’t you?” she
said, with unexpected directness.</p>

<p>He raised his eyebrows, and then they met in a frown.
He found her words in bad taste, which was not usual
with Claudia.</p>

<p>“I quite appreciate that my wife is admired by
other——”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I <em>am</em> your wife. Somehow—to-night—I
feel I must speak plainly and tell you—that I am not satisfied
with the crumbs that fall from the legislative table.
Once, before we were married, I warned you that such
scraps would not satisfy me. I want more. Any woman,
unless she were as cold as a stone and had only married
you for her own ends, would want more. Why, we are
hardly friends even! Oh, I don’t want to know the
details of your work, but you never discuss anything
with me. I am as lonely as I was before I married you....
I thought I was entering a land of plenty. You
made me think so. I knew I should never be content<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
with a conventional marriage.” She caught her breath
for a moment. “Yes, I remember my very words to
you—‘Love is the only convention that I own.’ Have
you forgotten?... If you value me and my love, think
over what I have said and look where we have drifted,
Gilbert. I daresay you haven’t noticed—that is the
worst part of it all—that we have drifted at all. Perhaps
you think that we stand where we did eighteen
months ago.... We none of us ever stand still even for a
single day and there’s a pretty strong current that
catches restless, unsatisfied women nowadays. And—I
am not satisfied, <em>I am not satisfied</em>.”</p>

<p>With a sudden abrupt movement, so foreign to her that
it showed how much she had been keeping herself in
leash, she went out and closed the door behind her.</p>

<p>He stood where she had left him, a look of annoyed
surprise upon his face. It was a real shock to him, and
a disagreeable one. He preferred to think that Claudia
was quite satisfied with their marriage. She had never
before complained of any specific thing. She did not
now. He told himself irritably that he wished she would,
it would make it so much easier to give her what she
wanted. The worst of women was that they were so
vague in their demands and their complaints. Men can
usually put down in black and white what they want;
women never. He loved her, she was his wife, she
shared his honor and the brilliant prospects for the
future. What more did she want? Why did women talk
in such an exaggerated way nowadays? Surely it was
her fault if she were not satisfied? He had never pretended
to any Paolo or Romeo-like passion; he had given
her instead a much more useful commodity in the twentieth
century—the good, honest heart of a real man,
instead of the mawkish sentiment of an unbusiness-like
poet. He had never run after other women as did so
many of the men he knew. Of course, Claudia might say
he had not had the time to do so, which was true. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
probably he could have made some time if he had wanted
to amuse himself. It was true that he had not wanted
to make love to any woman. After he had indulged his
natural passions in marrying Claudia, women had dropped
into the background again. Even the desultory emotions
which used to stir within him had not agitated him. He
could have lived a virtuous bachelor life with the greatest
of ease.</p>

<p>Claudia had dropped her gloves on the hearthrug and
left a soft, cloudy chiffon scarf on the leathern armchair.
With the sense of tidiness and order that characterized
him, he picked them up.</p>

<p>Did women know what they wanted nowadays? Was
it not the signs of the mental inflammation of the
times?</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the scent from the scarf—Claudia
used some delicate, haunting perfume—that caused an
idea to strike him, a very mundane masculine idea, but
still it had the grace of at least a faint touch of imagination.
The perfume revived memories.... There was
that night at Fyvie Castle on their honeymoon, when they
had watched the moon shining on the loch from her window,
he remembered the sweetness of her body nestling
against him on the old window-seat ... once he had
awakened with that perfume in his nostrils and found her
arms around his neck.... It had been playtime then,
but women were only children masquerading as grown-ups.
Had he found the key to her queer speech? Was
that what she had meant? Yes, in that way he had been
very neglectful the last few months and married women
had a right.... He recalled that she had sometimes
looked rather wistfully at him when he kissed her good-night
outside her door.... Oh, yes! that was the trouble.
How stupid of him!</p>

<p>He stopped to put away a few papers and then, ten
minutes later, he knocked at the door which divided
their rooms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>He waited, but there was no answer. He gently tried
the handle. The door was locked.</p>

<p>He listened intently and he thought he heard a sound
like a sob strangled in a pillow.</p>

<p>“Claudia, Claudia, may I come in?”</p>

<p>Now there was no sound at all.</p>

<p>“Claudia, I want to talk to you. Open the door.”</p>

<p>But still no movement in the room or any sign that
she had heard him, though he felt sure she must have
done so.</p>

<p>Then, with a shrug of his shoulders and a compression
of his lips that made him very like his father, he turned
away.</p>

<p>Two minutes later he was fast asleep. His father was
right, was his last reflection. There was no good trying
to understand women.</p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">THE GIRLIE GIRL</span></h3>

<p>The next morning, when Claudia opened her eyes
after a bad and restless night, she knew by Johnson’s
voice that some agitation was in the air.</p>

<p>“Madam, I am sorry to wake you so early, but your
mother has been ringing you up on the telephone. She
insisted on my waking you.”</p>

<p>For a moment Claudia’s dark eyes, still heavy with
sleep, stared at her vaguely. Then she sat up in bed with
a look of alarm. “What time is it? Half-past eight,
and mother wants to speak to me. Why, she is never
wakened until ten! What can have happened?”</p>

<p>Something in Johnson’s expression caught Claudia’s
eye and made her certain that she knew something.</p>

<p>“Johnson, is anything amiss? Is Pat ill or had an
accident?” Pat was the sort of wild, careless person
one always associates with possible accidents.</p>

<p>“No, madam, I—I should think it must be about Mr.
Jack. It’s all in the papers this morning. I thought
you couldn’t know anything about it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“Jack’s had an accident, then?” said Claudia, paling,
for in her way she was fond of him. “Is it very bad—tell
me quick, Johnson.”</p>

<p>“Madam,” gasped the woman, “it’s not exactly an
accident—I mean—oh! madam, let your mother tell
you.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Claudia remembered Mrs. Rivington’s words
of the previous evening. It was true, then. That could
be the only thing which would give Jack prominence in
the papers.</p>

<p>“All right, Johnson, don’t look so frightened. I think
I know. He’s got married, hasn’t he? All right, ring
up my mother and put me through. And fetch me a
newspaper, quick. Do that first, before you ring up.
Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“It’s here, madam; I thought perhaps——”</p>

<p>Claudia tore it open with shaking fingers, and Billie
rubbed his head against her arm in vain. A few minutes
ago she would have said, “What did it matter what a
young fool like Jack did?” Now she realized that she
was furiously angry, ridiculously angry. If he had
married this awful woman—Ah!</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>PEER’S GRANDSON MARRIES A MUSIC-HALL ARTISTE.</p>

</div>

<p>The words stared hideously at her as they would stare
at several thousand people who opened that page—friends,
enemies, acquaintances. The blood sang in her
ears as she tried to read the paragraph. She could hear
their friends shouting with laughter, she could see the
look of contempt on the faces of the people who mattered,
she could hear the course chuckles, the resurrected stories....
Ugh! disgusting.</p>

<p>The newspaper, a popular halfpenny, recounted in well-worn
journalistic phrases how The Girlie Girl of music-hall
fame last night confessed that she had been married
for several weeks to Captain Jack Iverson of the Blues, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
grandson of Lord Creagh and the son of the famous
society beauty whose picture, “Circe,” was known all
over Europe. “The bridegroom,” said the paper, “has for
some years been considered one of the richest and best-looking
young bachelors in Mayfair, and its dovecots will
be fluttered by the news of his marriage. It appears that
they were married before a registrar and the utmost secrecy
was observed, but truth will out, and last night Miss
Fay Morris, better known as The Girlie Girl, was the
recipient of much congratulation. Our reporter visited
her between the first and second houses and found her
dressing-room crowded with flowers. She is very popular
in the profession, and has made her successes in America,
South Africa and at home. She is very pretty, with a
<i lang="fr">petite</i>, perfect figure, and she possesses a considerable
store of vitality and go, so much that she is billed as ‘The
whirlwind dancer and mimic.’ Captain Iverson’s sister
is the wife of the new K.C., Gilbert Currey, and is considered
one of the most fascinating hostesses in
Society.”</p>

<p>Johnson hardly recognized her as she looked up from
the paper. It was just as bad as bad could be. The
Girlie Girl! The Girlie Girl! Could anything be more
vulgar and inane!</p>

<p>“You are through now,” said the maid, pushing the
table that held the telephone nearer to the bedside.
Claudia motioned her to leave the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Iverson’s voice was almost lost in a kind of weird
moan with which she punctuated her sentences.</p>

<p>“I knew something awful was going to happen,” she
said. “I was warned by the spirits three times in succession
... they told me that disaster was coming closer
and closer. It’s too awful, isn’t it? Of course, we can’t
know her. Jack must be mad. I’ve sent for him to
come to me at once, not, of course, that we can do anything
now. I couldn’t sleep and I heard two of the servants
talking about it while they did the stairs. He must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
divorce her or something. Fancy <em>marrying</em> a woman like
that. Do you realize it, Claudia, I’m the mother-in-law
of The Girlie Girl—I—I! My God, it’s incredible. Why,
musical comedy would have been better. Why didn’t
you stop it? Your father says he washes his hands of
him, but that doesn’t prevent her being my daughter-in-law.
If only the spirits had been more explicit in their
warnings ... but spirits are always so vague.... I was
afraid it meant that my masseur was going to die or my
maid was going to leave me.... I’m prostrate....
What’s the good of Jules massaging me when I’ve got
troubles like this? Do get dressed and come round—it’s
as bad as having a funeral in the house, only, thank goodness,
one doesn’t have to go into black.”</p>

<p>Claudia put back the receiver with a click, and Billie
gave a bark to remind her that she had not greeted him
kindly. She gave him an absent caress, her dark eyes,
full of thought, looking out over his soft little head. How
furious Gilbert would be! The Girlie Girl a sister-in-law
of the rising young barrister! She had long ago divined
his father’s and mother’s feeling against her own family,
partly shared by Gilbert. Lady Currey would be delighted!
A sarcastic smile curved her lips as Johnson
came in again.</p>

<p>Johnson’s eyes were glittering with excitement, for
servants love a good, rousing scandal.</p>

<p>In her excitement she called her mistress by her old
name. “Miss Claudia, Mr. Jack is downstairs and wants
to see you at once. I told him you were in bed and
hadn’t had your breakfast——”</p>

<p>There was a knock on the door, followed by her
brother’s voice.</p>

<p>“Claudia, let me come in. I <em>must</em> speak to you.”</p>

<p>Johnson looked at her, and for a moment Claudia’s
hands clenched themselves in helpless rage at the folly
of her brother. “Let him come in,” she said shortly,
“and send me up my breakfast!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>Johnson opened the door and Jack came in, his face
rather pitiable in its weakness and worry. He looked like
a puppy that has lost its way. He was as smartly dressed
and as well-groomed in person as usual—nothing short of
an earthquake would have made him regardless of his
attire, and then one felt he would have been resurrected
trying to put his tie straight—but his usual placid expression
of serene content with himself and that state of life
into which Providence had pleased to call him was gone.</p>

<p>He looked at Claudia rather helplessly and yet appealingly,
and some of the hardness of her glance melted.
After all, it was the same silly old good-natured Jack.</p>

<p>“Johnson, wait a minute. Have you had some breakfast?”</p>

<p>“Yes—no—you never can get anything to eat at the
flat.... I should like some coffee, Claudia. I think it
might pull me together if it was strong and very hot.”</p>

<p>He came to the bedside and sat down rather heavily
in a pink-cushioned chair. Mechanically he found his
cigarette-case and opened it.</p>

<p>“Oh! I beg your pardon, old girl. I forgot it was your
bedroom. It’s something to do.... You know all about it!”</p>

<p>She pointed without speaking to the paper flung in
disgrace to the foot of the bed.</p>

<p>“Oh, well! you know, then. Everybody knows. She
let it out last night. Women never can keep secrets.”</p>

<p>“Was she going to be your wife—secretly—for the
rest of your life?” said Claudia sarcastically.</p>

<p>“Eh? Oh, well! I didn’t want people to know yet.
She’s a clinking good sort, and don’t think”—with an
expression like the puppy on the scent again—“that I
regret marrying her. No, by Jove, I don’t. But she
might have let me break the thing to—to everyone.”</p>

<p>“You can’t break things like that,” said Claudia
sharply, “they break themselves. It’s like dropping an
egg—it’s smash. Jack, I do believe this dog has got
more sense than you have. I heard a rumour about this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
marriage last night, and I laughed at it. I had a certain
amount of respect for your—social intelligence. Brains
you never did have, but you always had good manners.
I’m utterly disgusted with you, and I never want to see
you—or your wife—again.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t seen her yet,” said Jack quickly. “So
you can’t judge things.”</p>

<p>“I have no intention of seeing her,” said Claudia, her
lips tightly compressed, her eyes flashing with anger.
“Do you expect me to take The Girlie Girl to my bosom
and swear I love her as a sister?”</p>

<p>“Look here, Claudia, say what you like about me—oh,
yes! I know it was a fool thing to do, although I don’t
regret it——” He passed his hand over his brow wearily,
for his small brain, so little used, was unequalled to the
strain. “I say again”—obstinately—“I don’t regret, and
I’m awful fond of her—she’s a nut, I can’t tell you—but
of course I can see how you and mother and everyone
look at it. I never would have believed I could have
done it—I’ve always jeered at other fellows who married
beneath them—but I was just crazy about her. You’ll
like her, Claudia,” he bent forward with pathetic eagerness,
his hand again seeking his cigarette-case, “she’s not
a bit like anyone else. All the men are in love with her,
and she could have married most anyone she wanted.”</p>

<p>Claudia’s expression was so indicative of her feelings
that he stopped. At that moment Johnson brought in the
breakfast-tray. Jack looked at it with relief. It was something
to do if only to eat and drink, and the cup of tea
Polly had given him that morning had been “wash.”</p>

<p>He noticed that Claudia’s hand shook as she started
to pour out the coffee, and at imminent danger to the
tray and his own clothes, he caught hold of her hand.</p>

<p>“Give us your paw, Claud. I say, old girl, don’t you
go against me. I came to you at once; you’ve always
been such a good chap, though you do scold me.” With
rough affection he put his arm round her and kissed her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
“I said to myself, ‘Old Claudia will stand by me. She
isn’t a conventional duffer like the others. She’ll see
Fay’s fascination, and, after all, a fellow’s only got one
life to live, and why can’t I do as I like?’ I’ve heard
you say things like that time and time again, and Gilbert’s
contradicted you. I daresay I’ve done a silly thing, but
if I don’t regret it, what is it to anyone else? Only
don’t you round on me. It makes me feel as if I’d gone
to my bath and there wasn’t any water.”</p>

<p>Claudia had to laugh, at first a little uncertainly, and
then with wild abandon. Jack’s similes, when he employed
any, were always so absurd.</p>

<p>“Jack, get away, the point of your collar is puncturing
my cheek.... Oh! you silly ass, how could you do it?
Now you’re upsetting the tray, and I love those pink
cushions.”</p>

<p>“Fay likes everything pale blue, but then, she’s got
blue eyes. Such blue eyes! They’re ripping, Claud. I
must give Billy some sugar—we’ll pretend it’s off the
wedding-cake. Claudie, next to you—at least, no, because
you’re so different, there isn’t any next-to—but you and
she are the most ripping women I’ve ever meet. I say,
I am glad of this coffee. I’m going to see that Fay has
some decent servants. Polly’s a sketch, a fair sketch.”</p>

<p>He was so frankly and boyishly relieved that she had
“made it up.” After all, he didn’t mind very much
about his father and mother—luckily his income was
his own—but Claudia did matter. And he was honestly
sure that Claudia would be fond of Fay when she knew
her.</p>

<p>After a while Claudia put the question: “She is going
to give up her profession, of course?”</p>

<p>His brow clouded. “Well, I want her to, and I’ve
talked till my throat has got dry, but she says she’s got
‘contracts,’ whatever that means, for the next six years.
And she’s so proud of them, too. Funny set of people,
you know. What there is to be proud of in having to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
work for six years more I can’t for the life of me see.
But she tells everyone.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it means that she’s a success and has been
secured by certain theatres,” said Claudia.</p>

<p>“Eh? Oh, yes! I suppose it does mean that. Oh, yes!
I see. That’s why she’s proud. What a nut you are,
Claudia, you are the brainy one of the family, right
enough. How’s Gilbert?”</p>

<p>She gave a slight shrug of her shoulders under the
silken matinée.</p>

<p>“Have you had a row over me?” he said quickly.
“Of course, you couldn’t explain a thing like this to
Gilbert.”</p>

<p>“You include him among the conventional duffers?”
said his sister, with an enigmatic smile, patting Billie
with one hand.</p>

<p>“Er—well—of course, he’s——”</p>

<p>“You’re quite right, my dear brother. He’s a conventional
<em>old</em> duffer.” Then, with an abrupt change of
key: “But, after all, as you say, we’ve only got one
life and we must each decide for ourselves how we will
live it. Live, love and be merry, for to-morrow we grow
old!”</p>

<p>“By Jove, old girl, that’s the right spirit, and I really
am awfully fond of Fay. And she’s gone on me, too.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been awfully in love with other girls before,”
said Claudia running her fingers through her soft,
loosened hair, “but you haven’t married them. How
did it happen?”</p>

<p>He evidently concentrated on the subject for a moment
before he answered:</p>

<p>“Blest if I quite know myself. I didn’t mean anything
of the kind at first, because I knew that she ... I don’t
know whether she put it in my head or I put it in hers.”</p>

<p>“You’re a very rich man,” said his sister softly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know; and I daresay she wouldn’t have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
married me if I hadn’t had a good deal of oof.” Catching
his sister’s look of surprise, he said quickly, “Oh! I
don’t kid myself it was love, pure love. I don’t believe
there is any such thing. And she’s as cute as they make
them, only—she can be just the other way sometimes,
too. She’ll interest you, Claudia, she really will. I bet
you haven’t met anything like her before. You’ll find
her a bit of a puzzle all right. But she’s got plenty of
money of her own; she earns quite a big salary, she tells
me, and though she lives in a sloppy sort of Bohemian
way, there’s always plenty to it and no end of fluff and
frills. Got plenty of jewellery, too, that—that admirers
have given her. I want to replace it all one day.”</p>

<p>“She has had plenty of admirers, then?”</p>

<p>He coloured a little and looked away. “Oh, well!
hang it all, who am I that I should hang out a blue
ribbon?—no, that’s teetotal, isn’t it?—well, you know
what I mean. But we’re both going to stick to one another
in future.”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t told me yet why you wanted to
marry her?”</p>

<p>He ruminatively twisted his small, fair moustache.
“Well, I don’t know. She didn’t feel for me the way
she felt for the other fellows, she said. Of course,
they’re an awful set, though I haven’t told her so yet.
And”—he got up and fidgeted with a photograph-frame,
it contained a portrait of Colin Paton—“she’s a queer
little person, Fay. She’s twenty-two and she says—she
says it’s time she became a mother, and she wants—the
father—to be a gentleman. I daresay she’d—she’d have
had it the other way—things like that don’t matter so
much to them—only, of course, I couldn’t. You see
that, don’t you, old girl?”</p>

<p>Claudia’s voice was very tender and affectionate as
she answered:</p>

<p>“Run away now, old boy, and let me get up. Yes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
you couldn’t, of course, and I’ll do my best to smooth
things over. Scribble down her address on that memorandum-tablet,
will you?”</p>

<p>He came over to her and gave her a bear-like hug.</p>

<p>“You’re a brick, Claudia. I always knew it.... I
say, you haven’t been looking the thing lately. Are you
<em>quite</em> happy yourself?”</p>

<p>She unloosened a strand of hair from his coat-button
with a little wince.</p>

<p>“Well, at any rate I married for love. And is anybody
quite happy? I guess life is rather like those bottles
of mixed sweets we used to have in the nursery. They
were all called ‘sweets,’ but some of them were very
sharp and acid, do you remember? We used to first
dig out the sugary ones, but nurse afterwards insisted
that we should eat the acid ones. Life is a thing of
spots and streaks, Jack; that’s all there is to it.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">UNE CHAMBRE À LOUER</span></h3>

<p>There is some uncatalogued sense in man which
seems immediately aware when a woman is at a
loose end, when there is <i lang="fr">une chambre à louer</i> in her
heart. There is a story told of Don Juan which relates
how the famous gallant was unsuccessful with three
women in his life; one was a middle-class woman who
adored her husband, the second was a nun who kept
true to her vows, and the third was a <i lang="fr">cocotte</i> who,
having lived the “gay life” for many years and “ ...
grown old in the service of pleasure, love no longer
made any appeal.” The woman who is estranged from
her husband, who no longer cares for him, has no need
to proclaim the tidings upon the house-tops. Men are
subtly and quickly aware that her heart is free, and consider
not only that she is fair game for any arrows they
may care to shoot, but that they are offering her something
she cannot live without and that she is sure to accept
from someone sooner or later. One often hears
a man speak of an unhappy wife as that “poor little
woman,” but he never doubts that he can make her happy
where her spouse has failed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>The face of life seemed now to change for Claudia.
Her admirers were bolder with their compliments, more
pressing in their invitations; and although some of them
were secretly rather intimidated by her direct-glancing,
critical eyes and occasionally cynical tongue, they gave
her plainly to understand that she need not waste her
sweetness upon the desert air. She had lost that happy,
absorbed look a woman wears when she is in love, but
her personality had gained from the social point of view,
for she was more arresting, more vivid, and she had
always been accounted a good companion and conversationalist.
But Claudia had not studied <i lang="fr">le monde où l’on
s’ennuie</i> for some years for nothing, and though she had
hitherto kept a little aloof from certain phases, she was
not ignorant, nor likely to let her vanity lead her into
foolishness. The obvious love-hunter only amused her,
and she used such men just as much as it suited her
convenience.</p>

<p>Besides Frank Hamilton she found only one man that
really interested her and whose companionship she enjoyed—Charles
Littleton, the American publisher. She
had met him since their first dinner-party at one or two
houses she frequented, and a sort of cheery understanding
had grown up between them. Her brain was much
more subtle than his, but he always responded when she
led the way. He had a sense of humour and all sorts of
stories to tell her of authors whom she only knew
between bookcovers. His talk was always racy, and he
occasionally used quaint idioms and expressions that
gave his conversation a different flavour from that which
was usually poured into her ears at dinners and at homes.</p>

<p>The breach between Claudia and Gilbert had not been
lessened by Jack’s <i lang="fr">mésalliance</i>. Gilbert writhed under
the publicity, and though he knew it was a nine-days’
wonder and would soon evaporate, he was infuriated with
the house of Iverson and the offspring of Circe. A letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
from his mother, quite illogical and trying to make him
appear responsible for the marriage, made him more
irritable. His reply to it was dignified, pointing out her
untenable position—the attitude of a strong man towards
women must be maintained, even with a mother—but he
felt the sting of it all the same. His father, whom he
met the next day, was not illogical, but there was an
atmosphere of chilliness and silence on the subject which
was probably more unpleasant to him than his mother’s
letter. A comic paper came out with a cartoon showing
him giving advice on her contracts to The Girlie Girl.
In view of it all, Claudia’s attitude was the worst of all.
She took up Jack’s own attitude, that he was at liberty
to do as he pleased with his life. She was logical and
perfectly calm during their discussions, and Gilbert, to
his great disgust, found himself forced into becoming
illogical, which is enough to exasperate any lawyer, even
a briefless one.</p>

<p>“It’s a disgrace to us all,” he said stormily, his sombre
grey eyes dark under the lowered lids, “a beastly
scandal.”</p>

<p>“Why are <em>we</em> disgraced?” said Claudia calmly, also
forced to assume a position she had never meant to take.
“She’s not your wife, she’s Jack’s.” A satirical smile
curved her lips as she tried to imagine Gilbert married
to The Girlie Girl.</p>

<p>“A family stands or falls together,” said Gilbert
heavily, noting the smile with inward resentment. Lately
he had often seen that smile on his wife’s lips.</p>

<p>“Oh! surely not, nowadays. It is hard enough to have
your own sins come home to roost, but to have your
sister’s and your brother’s and your cousin’s and your
aunt’s—Oh! life would be too hard!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be flippant; we are discussing a serious matter.”</p>

<p>“All the more reason not to lose our sense of humour.
Undiluted seriousness is—the devil. After all, aren’t we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
making a great fuss over nothing in particular? I confess
I was furious at first, but—Jack isn’t a German
Crown Prince or the heir of great possessions, you know.
I daresay it’s a lucky escape for some nice girl.”</p>

<p>“A pretty way to speak of your own brother!” he
flung at her.</p>

<p>“Oh, Gilbert! how old-fashioned you are! Don’t you
know a brother may be a friend or a stranger nowadays?
I’m fond of Jack, but I don’t think he is cut out to take
a firm and virtuous position on the family hearthrug.
He’s always been much too good-looking and too rich
to acquire goodness or have it thrust upon him. He
seems genuinely fond of her. I am quite curious to
see her.”</p>

<p>She settled herself more comfortably in the corner of
the couch and took up a book, as if to indicate that the
subject was exhausted. Gilbert stood looking down
upon her in his golfing kit. He made spasmodic efforts
to take exercise—he had put on a couple of stone since
their marriage—and being Saturday, he was free from
his chambers. They both belonged to the club at Sunningdale,
but lately he never suggested that she should
accompany him. Secretly, he was ashamed that she
should see how badly out of form he was, for Claudia
played fairly regularly, and had a good, clean stroke of
her own.</p>

<p>“See her?” he ejaculated. “I must ask you not to
try and see her or identify yourself with this disastrous
marriage in any way.” He made use of the word <em>ask</em>,
but the tone made it equivalent to <em>forbid</em>. He did not
want to go and play golf, although he felt he ought to,
and the picture that Claudia made in her soft silken
draperies, snugly ensconced in the well-warmed room,
gave an additional edge to his tone.</p>

<p>Claudia raised her expressive eyebrows and turned
a page of the book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“Really, Gilbert, I will not ask her here to meet
you——”</p>

<p>“I should think not, indeed!”</p>

<p>“—but I have promised Jack that I will go and see
her. What I do in future depends on—her and myself.
After all, she is Jack’s wife and he is fond of her.”</p>

<p>“Do you know this woman is—is notorious, that she
is what men call ‘hot stuff’? Can’t you see that she
has only married your brother to fleece him and degrade
his family?”</p>

<p>His eyes were black with anger and his lower lip protruded
pugnaciously, just as his father’s did. Claudia
watched him, fascinated, for this was the first real
quarrel they had had. In the midst of a pregnant silence
the door opened, and the manservant announced “Mr.
Paton.”</p>

<p>They were both so angry that they had not time enough
to pull down the blinds before Paton was in the room,
and he saw two people as he had never seen them before.
Then they both recovered themselves—Claudia more
easily than her husband—and went forward to greet him.</p>

<p>“Colin, what a delightful surprise!” cried Claudia,
taking his hand in hers. “I <em>am</em> glad to see you again.”
Perhaps there was also a little relief at the interruption
of an unpleasant scene, but she was unfeignedly glad to
feel his firm hand-clasp once more. She was almost
surprised herself to find how glad she was.</p>

<p>“Hallo, old chap, back again, then?” said Gilbert. “It’s
good to see you. Safe and sound, eh? You look fit
enough,” he added, ruefully casting a look down at himself.
“Why do some men put on fat and others don’t?”</p>

<p>Paton laughed. “I suppose I belong to the lean kine.
Yes, I think you have put on flesh, Gilbert.”</p>

<p>In truth he was a little shocked at the deterioration
in his old friend’s appearance. He had always been
rather heavy for his age, but now a heaviness of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
spirit as well as of the body seemed to have settled upon
him. Surely the lids drooped more over the rather lifeless
eyes, and his chin and jowl were coarser? He
himself was much the same as when he had left England
before the wedding, spare, erect, in obvious good form.</p>

<p>“It’s abominable,” said Gilbert. “It isn’t what I eat,
either.”</p>

<p>The manservant opened the door again. “The car is
at the door, sir.”</p>

<p>“Going golfing?” smiled Paton. “Ah! I haven’t done
that for a great while. Sounds sort of homely and
English. I’m sure you could beat me into a cocked hat,
Claudia, and I used to give you—how many strokes a
hole?”</p>

<p>“Ah! but I’ve been practising religiously with the
deadly purpose of defeating you when you returned,”
laughed Claudia gaily, the colour back again in her
smooth, creamy cheeks. It was jolly to see Colin again.
One could always talk nonsense or sense to Paton, and
she suddenly realized that nobody had ever taken his
place in that respect. “I’ll take you on to-morrow at
Stoke Poges. I am thirsting for vengeance for old
affronts.”</p>

<p>“I say! I shall expect at least to get a ball in my
eye or a gentle tap with the brassie. Still, let me like
a golfer fall! I’ll take you on. And, Gilbert, what’s
your form?”</p>

<p>“Oh! he’s going down to see his parents to-morrow,”
replied Claudia carelessly, ringing for the tea. “When
did you land?”</p>

<p>“Yesterday.”</p>

<p>Claudia was pleased. He had lost no time in coming
to see them.</p>

<p>Although Paton had been his friend long before he
had known Claudia, Gilbert had a curious feeling that
he was not wanted. He felt they were eager to talk over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
many things. Paton would probably tell her all about
his travels—well, travellers’ tales were apt to be boring.</p>

<p>“I shall see you again soon, Colin. I’d arranged to go
this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Let’s have lunch together early next week.”</p>

<p>“I will if I can, but I’m infernally busy just now. Get
a vacation soon though, thank goodness.”</p>

<p>The door closed behind him, and as if the impulse
were mutual, they found themselves shaking hands
again.</p>

<p>“Colin, what a long time you’ve been away. Don’t
dare to tell me you’ve any plans for going away again,
because I shall <em>really</em> hit you on the head with the brassie
and incapacitate you.”</p>

<p>It was a woman who teased him now, not the fresh,
eager-eyed girl he had left. But from most men’s point
of view she had gained more, much more than she had
lost. She had acquired a nice, physical balance, that had
been wanting before. She had the charm of early maturity.
She was a woman who knew her power over
men, and knew just what that power meant. She was
on the surface even more frankly gay and charming,
but it hid certain reserves. She would pretend to be
more confidential and open, but would be less so. She
would never shut a door with a bang in anybody’s face,
but it would be shut quietly all the same. In the few
minutes that he had been with her, Colin realized all this
and, mingled with his admiration for her development—for
he found her far handsomer than she had been—there
was a touch of regret for the girl who had talked
about anything and everything, and as frankly answered
questions as she asked them. She was Gilbert’s wife,
a woman of the world, and—a great deal more.</p>

<p>“Taking stock of me?” she laughed, meeting his eyes.
“But I don’t think Topsy had growed much this time.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, I think she has grown a good deal,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
he said quietly. “You haven’t grown into a giraffe or a
fat Boy Joey, but all the same you have grown.”</p>

<p>She rested her head on her hand, her elbow propped
on the arm of the couch, and looked speculatively at
him. He reminded her of those days before her marriage,
when she had spelt marriage with a capital letter.
And—yes—she did look back at herself from one side
of a huge gulf. Was that gulf growth? She realized
more what life meant, and might mean. She had touched
hard facts, unalterable laws of nature, great moments,
petty awakenings ... was all that growth?</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right,” she said slowly.</p>

<p>“I am sure I am right. You have shot up at an
alarming rate. You think before you speak now, a most
potent symptom! In the old days you would have blurted
out ‘I haven’t grown,’ with great suddenness and force,
and I should have been laid low by your vehemence.”</p>

<p>Claudia smiled. “You mean I begin to know that I
don’t know. I think I do realize that my landmarks are
shifting.”</p>

<p>“An awfully good sign,” he said cheerfully. “I’m
always pulling up mine and planting them again. A constantly
uprooted landmark gathers no moss.... Do I
smell the smell of muffins? Claudia, this is heaven,
indeed, and you are the ministering angel.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t much of an angel about me,” said Claudia,
rather jerkily, when the servant had withdrawn. “If
I’m growing—I’m growing much nastier. I’m growing
so short-tempered and prickly, and——”</p>

<p>She stopped. She had heard a faint, a very faint
sound at the door. Paton, whose hearing was as quick
as her own, had heard it too.</p>

<p>“Is that my old friend, Billie the Blessed Dachshund?”
he asked. “Bless his stumpy legs! May I let him in?”</p>

<p>She nodded, surprised to find that her eyes had suddenly
filled with tears. Why, she did not know. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
had she been about to confess to him? It was just as
well Billie had interrupted.</p>

<p>Billie gave Paton a royal welcome, a most unusual
welcome for him. For of all the hands that caressed
him, he liked Paton’s next to his adored mistress. Billie
would have told you that there are hands and hands.
Some are heavy as lead on small dogs’ heads, some are
blunt and stupid, some are cold and clammy, and send
a shiver down a dog’s spine, and there are hands that
are delicate and sensitive, and convey a sense of liking
that is most comforting to the canine tribe.</p>

<p>“Verdict—not grown!”</p>

<p>They both laughed heartily, and Billie stood with a
smile—it certainly was a smile—and with his tail wagging
surveying them both.</p>

<p>“You have preserved your figure admirably, Billie. I’ll
proceed to put it in jeopardy with this lump of sugar....
How nice of you, Claudia, to remember no milk in my
tea.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you saw that Gilbert and I were having—what
shall I call it?—a row when you came in?” said
Claudia calmly, her hands busy among the silver.
“Oh! we were in a most exciting part when the door
opened.”</p>

<p>“All couples quarrel occasionally, don’t they?” he
said lightly. “That’s part of the joys of married life,
isn’t it? Marriage is a sort of licence to quarrel and
afterwards make it up.”</p>

<p>“Oh! we don’t quarrel as a rule. Perhaps it would
be better if we did. No, this was a special and particular
quarrel, with a particular verse and chapter. You’ve
heard of Jack’s asinine marriage, of course?”</p>

<p>“Yes it was in the papers when I landed.”</p>

<p>“What do you think about it?”</p>

<p>“Now, what is the good of asking me that? Do you
want me to tell you what <em>I</em> wouldn’t have done, or what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
<em>I</em> think he should have done? What’s the use? He’s
done what he wanted to do.”</p>

<p>“Ah! you take that attitude too.”</p>

<p>“What can one say about a man’s marriage, except
perhaps to regret or be glad? I don’t pretend that if I
were a boy’s father, I shouldn’t be horribly annoyed with
him for doing a thing that will probably be a failure. It
was a surprise to you?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely. You know the sort of man Jack is.
There have always been Girlie Girls of sorts. Only
marriage is a different proposition, isn’t it? ‘Blest be
the tie that binds,’ et cetera.”</p>

<p>He nodded. “A great pity, of course. Have you seen
her? What is she like?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I haven’t seen her yet. That was the
finishing touch to our quarrel. I’ve promised Jack to go
and see her. After all, Jack is my brother, and he put
it in such a way that—well, I felt I wanted to see her. I
suppose she will be too awful for words?”</p>

<p>He hesitated for a moment. He wondered why it
jarred on him, the idea of her going to see Fay Morris.
He had heard a good many stories about her, and he
had several times come in contact with music-hall artistes—there
had been some on the boat he went out on. But
he was catholic in his tastes and mind, and personally
he would never have drawn aside from contact with
another human being. But Claudia with Fay Morris,
Claudia in the Bohemian, over-heated atmosphere of the
music-hall!</p>

<p>“Yes, I see, you think it will be all that. I suppose
Jack is quite mad.”</p>

<p>He forced himself to be just. “I don’t think we can
say that. You know, all sorts of stories go round about
such people, and she may be quite—quite maligned. She
is young, only twenty-two, and there’s every chance with
youth, you know. She can’t be viciously fair, fat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
forty. And you were always interested in humans,
Claudia.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! I still am, more so than ever. If someone
were just taking me to see her as a curiosity, it would
be different. But, Colin, she’s my sister-in-law! Suppose
she talks Cockney, and drops her aitches, and calls me
‘dearie’ or something!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it won’t be as bad as that,” suggested Colin,
not liking the picture at all, and wishing he could go
with her. “What does Jack say about her?”</p>

<p>“Oh! nothing that tells you anything. And I can’t
ask such questions of him, can I? Of course, Gilbert is
furious at the idea of my going to see her. I think—I
think he was going to forbid me to go and visit her, when
you came in. What do you think?”</p>

<p>He hesitated, for he knew it was a ticklish matter to
arbitrate, or attempt to do so, between husband and wife.</p>

<p>“I don’t need to think at all,” he said, after a pause.
“You’re his sister, and you’ve got to do the thinking.
And what you think should go, as the Americans say.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” She drew a deep breath and put her hand
impulsively on his arm, a little trick she had with people
she liked. “You are a real comfort, Colin. In future I
shall throw all my problems on you.”</p>

<p>Frank Hamilton came in, as he was patting her hand,
the two standing close together, and instant jealousy and
suspicion filled him at the sight. It was the first time
he had ever seen Claudia show any particular favour to
a man, she was rather difficult to approach, and though
it encouraged him not to be too diffident, he was also
very angry with her. A couple of years ago he would
have shown by his manner that he had noticed the little
incident, but he had learned some of the usages of
Mayfair, and he controlled himself. It showed itself,
however, in a little stiffness.</p>

<p>“Oh! Mr. Hamilton, let me introduce you to my old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
friend, Mr. Colin Paton. He has just come back from
the Argentine, where I suppose there are no pictures?”</p>

<p>“Only Nature’s, and those of the most wonderful. I
read an account of one of your exhibitions in a paper
that was sent out to me, Mr. Hamilton. I should have
liked to see that show.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Paton educated my taste in pictures,” said
Claudia, with a friendly glance at him. “He insisted on
my liking the good things, and then I really did.”</p>

<p>“Don’t believe her, Mr. Hamilton, she was always an
excellent natural judge of pictures.”</p>

<p>“But I did like them rather painty, at first, Colin, you
must admit that. Do you remember that Leighton I
adored and the Dicksee I found so poetical? And I
made you stand and gaze at them, too. You must have
stored up many a grudge against me for that.”</p>

<p>Hamilton had heard Claudia speak of “a friend now
abroad,” who had been her constant companion at
picture-galleries and who had lent her several art books.
But he had somehow got the idea that the friend was
middle-aged, if not old. He wondered how he had got
the idea, but something in Claudia’s tone had conveyed
it to his mind. The man that he saw was neither quite
young, middle-aged, nor old, and yet Hamilton felt there
was a steady fund of youth in him. He instinctively
understood that this man’s judgment would be worth
having, that those quiet, keen eyes would make short
work of his careless and meretricious paintings. For,
though usually he was amply content with his own
ability, he was aware at intervals that some of it left
much to be desired, both in form and execution. He had
a heaven-born gift for catching a likeness, and a great
feeling for colour, but his technique was faulty, and
lately he had done too much and too little.</p>

<p>“I shall be giving another exhibition next month. I
hope you will come to it,” he replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>“I shall make a point of doing so.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go together,” said Claudia promptly, so
promptly and so simply that some of the sting went out
of his jealousy. After all, this man was exceedingly
good form, and all that, but he was not good-looking,
and though he knew about art, apparently he did nothing
in that line. And Claudia had told him that she liked
people who did things.</p>

<p>He determined to make a possible enemy into a friend.
“Mr. Paton, if you are interested in the service of art,
do persuade your friend here to give me some more
sittings for her portrait. I made a ghastly failure of
my first attempt, but I think I can do much better now.
I’ve got the thing in my mind and I’m aching to begin.”</p>

<p>“Having your portrait painted, Claudia? That’s good
news. To increase the joy of nations you must give
him some sittings.”</p>

<p>“It’s so tiresome sitting still,” said Claudia, looking at
him plaintively out of the corners of her eyes. “I never
was great at sitting still.” Woman-like, she did not give
the real reason. She had begun to be afraid of those
sittings, and as she met Frank’s eyes she felt that feeling
re-awaken. He was too good-looking, too attractive to
sit to.</p>

<p>“There!” exclaimed Frank. “That’s what an artist
has to contend with. Laziness, pure laziness! And she
calls herself interested in art!”</p>

<p>“Paint Mrs. Jacobs instead,” teased Claudia, with a
gleam of mischief in her eyes, which set his blood afire.</p>

<p>“I’ve said it—inwardly.... Mr. Paton, help me.”</p>

<p>“I would like to see a good portrait of you,” said
Colin earnestly. “You ought to make such a good subject.
I quite understand Mr. Hamilton’s anxiety to paint
you. Do it—for the sake of your friends.”</p>

<p>She looked at Hamilton, but she really answered Paton.
After all, she had not too many real friends, and he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the best of them all, the most faithful, the most reliable
and unchanging.</p>

<p>“Very well. I’ll make a martyr of myself in the cause
of friendship. I’ll come one day next week. Will that
do?”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">“MISS FAY MORRIS THAT WAS”</span></h3>

<p>It was still only a little past five when the two men
departed, and Claudia found herself alone with a
very restless mood. Had it been earlier she would have
gone out and walked in the Park, for she often tramped
away a mood of restlessness. But it was grey and dismal
outside. She glanced at the piano, but that was not
the right thing. She picked up her book—one of Anatole
France’s—but that also she put down again in a very
few minutes. Then the idea came to her. Her eyes
opened widely and she caught her under-lip with her
small teeth. Would she?</p>

<p>Billie looked at her, and he knew she was going out.</p>

<p>“No, Billie, can’t take you this time. Oh! well, yes,
you can stop in the car.”</p>

<p>“What hat will madame wear?” said Johnson, her
hand on the cupboard that contained her hats.</p>

<p>Claudia considered carefully, and decided on her most
becoming one. It was a delightful possession, mostly
composed of pearl-grey feather shading to the softest
pink, and round her neck she wore a little necklet to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
match. Johnson wondered why she was so excited that
she pulled a button off her gloves and demanded a fresh
pair. It seemed as though her mistress was not going to
make an ordinary call.</p>

<p>“Now, Billiken, we must be off. I wonder! I
wonder!”</p>

<p>She went over first to her writing-table and abstracted
a little bit of paper. Jack’s writing was atrocious, but she
could decipher it with some difficulty. 25<span class="smcapuc">A</span>, Gilchrist
Mansions, Bloomsbury.</p>

<p>The car threaded its way through the crowded streets,
and after what seemed a long time to Claudia, it stopped
before a large block of flats, very red and very white,
and obviously trying to show how gloomy was the rest
of the square. Evidently it was a new block, and for
this Claudia was thankful. Ugly youth is better than
ugly age.</p>

<p>There was a lift, which she entered, with a rather
obsequious and yet familiar liftman, who, when she asked—after
some natural hesitation—for <em>Mrs. Iverson</em>, said,
“Miss Fay Morris that was, you mean, madam? Oh, yes!
it’s the third floor.” Claudia fancied that he eyed her
curiously as he manipulated the wires. She tried to brace
herself for the ordeal, for now she was ascending in the
lift she felt like hurriedly descending and running away.
There was no doubt it was an ordeal. It is quite bad
enough in the ordinary way to have to make the first call
on a new sister-in-law, but when she is “Miss Fay Morris
that was,” whose portraits adorned the entrances of
several music-halls, it is a colossal undertaking. She
wished most heartily she had asked Jack to take her.
Why had she not thought of that? How foolish of her.
But now she was here she must face the music. Perhaps
Jack would be there. If so, it would be all right. And
yet, in a way she would rather not have him there, for
though he was as stupid as an owl, there was a sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
understanding between them, and he would know what
impression his wife was making on her.</p>

<p>She rang the bell and waited. There was no answer.
Ah! a reprieve. She was turning away, but the liftman
said reassuringly, “Ring again, ma’am. She’s in, I know.
But the parrot makes such a noise they can’t hear the bell.”</p>

<p>So that was the meaning of the curious screeching she
had heard while waiting, like someone at the mercy of
a clumsy dentist. How could anyone stand such awful
sounds!</p>

<p>The door opened and a servant, still in a print dress,
nodded when she asked if Mrs. Iverson were at home.
The screeching had grown worse, and Claudia quite
understood why the servant nodded. She noticed that
she wore no cap and that her hair was outrageously
frizzed and curled. Was this the servant Jack had called
“a sketch, a fair sketch”?</p>

<p>The good-sized hall was cheery enough with plenty of
red paper and red carpet, perhaps a thought too cheerful,
as though the decorator had said, “Now let’s have a
cheerful hall, a very cheerful hall.” There was a large
imitation oak stand, crowded with oddments in the way
of coats. Claudia caught glimpses of a white knitted
coat, a long squirrel one, a dark fur stole and two or three
overcoats. There were any amount of umbrellas, walking-sticks,
etc., and over all was a strong smell of cooking.</p>

<p>“Chuck it! Chuck it! Chuck it!” shrieked the parrot
from somewhere near at hand. Claudia gave a start.</p>

<p>“Only that blessed bird,” said the servant. “She’s in
there, miss.”</p>

<p>She jerked her head in the direction of a door that
was a little ajar and suddenly departed. Claudia opened
her lips to speak, but the maid had gone.</p>

<p>“Chuck it! Chuck it!” came more faintly from evidently
the kitchen regions.</p>

<p>Claudia felt a strong desire to laugh. Then she heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
a voice singing in a room on her right. It seemed to
be the door the servant had indicated. The voice was
untrained, but of a good quality, sweet and rather high-pitched.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="stanza">

<div class="verse">And what I don’t know is——”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The rest seemed somehow smothered and she could not
catch the words.</p>

<p>Claudia tapped at the door in considerable embarrassment.
Would she have to announce herself, and what
would she say?</p>

<p>She pushed open the door gently and she saw a most
remarkable sight, nothing less than a pair of exquisitely
shaped little legs and feet in white silk tights that seemed
to belong to a frilly pink lampshade. That was Claudia’s
first impression, and then she saw that someone had her
back to her, delving down into a huge trunk. Her
second impression was that she had never seen a room
that was so blue! There were pale blue curtains, wall-paper
and bed-spread, blue flowers on the carpet and
satin bows everywhere.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Madam Rose?” said a voice from the
depths, which was rough and unrefined, but was <em>not</em>
Cockney. “Half a jiff. I can’t find my pink shoes
and——”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said Claudia, standing in the
doorway, “but I am not Madame Rose. The maid did
not——”</p>

<p>Claudia had just time to catch a glimpse of a piquant
little face with great surprised blue eyes, when there was
a cry of pain. The lid of the trunk, a heavy, clamped
one, had descended on the small hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, gracious!” said the ballet-like person, hopping
about holding her hand; “oh! that damned trunk! Ouch!
My goodness! it’s nearly broken my knuckles.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Her little face was screwed up with pain, so that she
hardly looked at her visitor. Claudia’s eyes caught sight
of a jug of water steaming away on the untidy washstand,
and she quickly went over to it.</p>

<p>“Here,” she said, “put your hand in this jug. That
will stop the pain and prevent it discolouring. Yes, I
know how those things hurt.”</p>

<p>The hand was so small that it easily slid down into the
jug. Claudia marvelled at its size, and then she noticed
that the girl was hardly up to her shoulders. Why, it
looked like a small child. This could not be The Girlie
Girl, surely?</p>

<p>Then she became aware that the wrinkles had come
undone and that the big blue eyes were looking at her.</p>

<p>“My word!” The blue eyes stared at her with the
directness and <i lang="fr">naïveté</i> of a child. The small mouth
dropped open a little as companion in the process. “Who
are you? I thought at first you were Madame Rose
with my new set of curls, and then cocking half an eye
at you, I thought you must be Maudie de Vere. But—who
on earth are you?”</p>

<p>“Is your hand better?” said Claudia, half smiling, half
embarrassed. “Please tell me first, are you—Fay?”</p>

<p>The girl looked at her with a sudden seriousness. “Yes,
and I guess who <em>you</em> are. You’re Jack’s sister, aren’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned Claudia. “I’m Jack’s sister. I am
sorry to come in this unceremonious way into your
bedroom——”</p>

<p>“Oh! that doesn’t matter,” said Fay, never taking her
eyes off Claudia’s face, “everybody comes in here when
they want me, because I’m hardly ever out of it....
My!”—her feelings overcoming her—“you <em>are</em> handsome!
Jack told me you were good-looking, but he didn’t
tell me you were such a stunner. I never saw anyone
so pretty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>It was impossible to resent the frank criticism or the
speaker as she stood there in her most extraordinary
attire. For the fluffy, chiffony petticoats ended just
below the knees, and over her shoulders she had thrown
a lacy matinée jacket, adorned with pale blue ribbons
and showing a neck and throat perfect in a miniature
way. Her hair—jet black and in remarkable contrast
to her eyes, which seemed as though they should belong
to a head of flaxen hair—was rather short, but fell about
her shoulders in curly masses.</p>

<p>Claudia was completely at a loss how to answer this
very naive tribute to her charms. But Fay was used to
making the entire conversation, and she went on without
noticing any lack of conversational powers on the part of
her visitor.</p>

<p>“I might have known it wasn’t Maudie, though, because
she uses so much scent it’s like a chemist’s shop
coming into your room. I like a little sprayed on myself,
but she puts it on with a garden hose. I’ve told her
about it heaps of times. I think it’s such bad taste, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>It was not quite the conversation Claudia had vaguely
imagined. And yet, though Fay gabbled on, her words
coming at a tremendous speed, she felt that her hostess
was taking good stock of her. At the back of those
childish eyes there was a shrewd little brain. She
showed this by her next words:</p>

<p>“You’re hopping mad with Jack and me, aren’t you?
I never saw Jack in such a state as the morning when
the thing came out in the newspaper.” She gave a little
chuckle. “I must say I enjoyed it. I like to keep my
name before the public, for one thing. You’ve got to
keep on working some sensation, or you’re passed over.”
She pulled her hand out of the jug and dried it on a
towel, which she flung on the very ornate bed. It had
a lace coverlet over pale blue satin, and enormous bows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
of pale blue satin ribbon ornamented the corners. A
huge nightdress-case of the same satin painted with pink
roses was lying on the frilled pillows, which were also
threaded with pale blue.</p>

<p>She came over to where Claudia was standing. “I
say, don’t be mad with me. I like you. I didn’t think
I would. I thought you’d be starchy and turn up your
nose at me. It was nice of you to think of that hot
water for my hand. Sit down and make friends with
me, will you?”</p>

<p>Claudia appreciated her charm as she stood in front
of her, playing with her sable muff. It was the charm
of the <i lang="fr">gamine</i>-child.</p>

<p>“I—I came to have a little talk with you,” returned
Claudia, smiling. You simply could not help smiling
at it.</p>

<p>“That’s right. Sit down. Bless me, there never is
a chair that isn’t littered up.” She took a handful of
clothes and threw them carelessly on the floor. “Now
just sit down there and tell me what the people you
know say about me. I suppose I shouldn’t have married
Jack, and I told him at first he’d better run away and
play with Lady Somebody or other. But he wouldn’t
go. He’ll tell you that if you ask him.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take your word for it,” returned Claudia as Fay
energetically seized a brush and commenced to brush
her hair.</p>

<p>“Oh! bother!” she said, stopping short, “and I want
those curls. Madame Rose is a blighter all right. She
promised them for to-day. Well, Polly will have to rake
those other curls over and make them presentable.” She
went to the door and shouted, “Polly! Polly! come here
quick.”</p>

<p>A red-haired girl came running in, her hands all wet
and soapsuddy. “Miss Fay, I’m just washing your
stockings.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“Leave ’em and come and dish up these curls. That
old beast hasn’t sent my new set. Look, Polly, this is
Mr. Jack’s sister. Isn’t she lovely?”</p>

<p>The red-haired girl stared at Claudia with her
greeny-brown eyes. Claudia had never been inspected
by a servant in such a manner before. Her lips
twitched, but she assisted Polly by looking straight at
her.</p>

<p>“She ain’t much like the Capting, is she?” Polly said
in strong Cockney. “But then, I ain’t a bit like my
brother. He’s in the army too. I always say as brothers
and sisters——”</p>

<p>“Don’t chatter so much. Take those curls and
vanish.” Fay waved her small hand imperiously, and
Polly, grabbing a bunch of curls, went out. “We don’t
want her in here listening to us, do we?” said Fay confidentially.
“Not but that Polly knows most everything.
She was on the halls once herself—doing small stunts
with an acrobat—and she got rheumatic fever. My
mother saved her life and kept her going for goodness
knows how long. When mar died, she came to me as
a sort of dresser. And she runs everything here.” She
waved her hand round the apartment. “The tradesmen
don’t do her. As far me, I’m no good at housekeeping.
Don’t know a chicken from a turkey. Of course, Jack
says she isn’t smart enough. He says he wants me to
have some proper servants. But, what’s the trouble?
I’m comfortable, and that’s everything, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“The best of servants can only make you comfortable,”
conceded Claudia, looking at the littered apartment.
There was a cup and saucer on the dressing-table, and
the spoon was on the floor. Some biscuits and an orange
were side by side with a powder-puff and a scent-spray.
One satin slipper rested on the pin-cushion, and a pair
of silk stockings were thrown over the mirror, which
had enormous wings and occupied a large amount of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
available space. Fay was busily putting up her hair as
she talked.</p>

<p>“You know, I’m awfully gone on your brother. I
never met anyone like him before.” Now she was energetically
rubbing cold cream all over her neck and arms.
“I like to make up at home. It’s much more comfortable.
Those dressing-rooms are so draughty. Have you ever
seen me? But of course you have. I suppose <em>everybody</em>
has. I top the bill at most of the halls now. And I
make a row when I don’t. Do you like my turn?”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to say I seldom go to variety houses,” said
Claudia, feeling somehow that she ought to have seen
her.</p>

<p>“What!”—she turned, with her face smothered with
grease. “You haven’t seen me do my turn? Jack must
take you this very night. He’ll be along soon.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I—er—am afraid I’m engaged to-night.”</p>

<p>Polly returned and planked the curls down on the
dressing-table.</p>

<p>“Here you are, miss, and Mr. Robins is out in the hall.
He wants to see you.” She grinned. “He’s got a bucket
for yer.”</p>

<p>“What!” Fay screamed gleefully, “old Joey Robins!
Why, this is worth a week’s screw.” She rushed to the
door just as she was and called out: “Come in, Joey, my
boy. I’m awful glad to see you.”</p>

<p>She flung her arms round the neck of a man whose
face was typically that of a low comedian of the old
school. He was funny even off the stage, and Claudia
vaguely remembered the name. He was somewhere
about fifty, and had a habit of blinking as he talked, like
a parrot. Claudia found out afterwards that he had
acquired it for stage purposes—the audiences shrieked
at him when he just blinked and did nothing else—and
he could not rid himself of it in private life.</p>

<p>“Come in, do. Joey, this is my sister-in-law. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
know Joey? You may not know me, but you know Joey
all right. Joey Robins on the Razzle-Dazzle! My! that
was a good number, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>She put her head on one side and her hands on her
hips, and began to skip about, humming a catchy tune.</p>

<p>Claudia found the comedian was extending a large and
very rough hand. “Glad to make your acquaintance,
miss. I say, Fay, there’s a turnip for you outside. Shall
I fetch it in?”</p>

<p>“Rather! You don’t mean it’s—— Oh! Joey, you
darling!” It was an immense bouquet of the old-fashioned
kind, and it was tied with long, streaming ribbons of
white satin. “I told ’em not to stint the ribbing. I
said my little gal don’t get married hevery day. Well,
my dear, how does it agree with you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, fine!” she laughed, using a little brush to darken
her eyelashes. “Wasn’t you surprised when you saw it
in the papers?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the man, still blinking, “not exsakerly surprised.
I always said you was fit to be a princess. I
see you’re at the Royal this week? Best advertisement
you hever ’ad, my girl.”</p>

<p>“And I don’t forget I owe it all to you,” she said
earnestly, leaving off with one eyelash blacked. “Yes,”
turning to Claudia, who did not feel left out in the cold,
because Fay took it for granted that she was interested
in this queer, common man who had come in, “he got
me my first engagement, and I don’t forget it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, go on! it was nothing.”</p>

<p>“Well, I shall never make light of it,” she said, with a
vigorous nod of her small head, now entirely over-weighted
with the curls she had pinned on. They spoilt
the shape of her head and stuck out in masses about her
ears. Fay went on quickly with the making-up process.
“You gave me a shove here and a shove there, and now
I’ve got into high society, I don’t forget those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
helped me. I’m going to give a dinner to celebrate the
wedding—you must come”—nodding friendly-wise to
Claudia—“and so must you and your missus, Joey.”</p>

<p>“It’s kind of you, Fay, but I’ll be up north for the
next month.” He looked at a large gold watch, the
chain of which meandered over a waistcoat of startling
pattern. “Can’t stay many minutes. Got to get down
to Reading to-night. Came up a purpose to bring you
the turnip.”</p>

<p>“You’re a duck, Joey. Polly! <em>Polly!</em> Bring in a
bottle of fizz. Sharp’s the word! Yes, Joey, it’s a
special occasion and I’d like <em>her</em> to have some too. You
know”—speaking to both of them—“I never take nothing
until after I’ve done my work, unless it’s a glass of
stout, but Joey’s got to drink me a proper health. Come
on, Polly, bring a glass for yourself.”</p>

<p>“Hallo, Polly!” said Joey, “still ginger, eh? My,
we’re getting on in the world, ain’t we? You fancy
yourself, waiting on the wife of a capting, don’t yer?
I’ll do that for yer. You hold the glass.”</p>

<p>“It’s the best fizz,” said Fay, who was now putting
the rouge thickly on her cheeks. “It costs ten shillings
a bottle and that’s wholesale price too. I know a man—do
you know Sam Levy? He’s got an interest in a
champagne business, or something. Anyway, I told him
to get me some of the best. Jack says it’s too sweet,
but I like it that way. The other stuff tastes like ginger-ale.
When I have fizz I like to know it’s fizz. But
there”—she turned to Claudia, who at half-past six in
the evening somehow found herself holding a glass of
champagne—“I suppose you drink champagne every
night of your life, don’t you?”</p>

<p>At that instant Jack came in at the door, which was
wide open.</p>

<p>“Just in time old boy,” called out Fay. “This is my
old friend Joey Robins—my husband.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“Please to meet you sir—I mean capting,” murmured
Joey Robbins, blinking at him. “You’ve got the smartest
little woman in the world as your wife, sir. There’s no
one to touch her in her perfession. Lord! she did for
old Joey long ago. She fairly beat his heart to a pulp.”</p>

<p>Jack had just caught sight of Claudia, and his face
was a curiosity to behold.</p>

<p>“But,” said Joey, with a rough note of kindly earnestness
in his voice, “no larking any more, Fay, my dear.
Be a good child, be a good child.”</p>

<p>Fay slipped her arm round Jack’s neck, standing on a
footstool to do so.</p>

<p>“We’re both going to be good children, aren’t we, Jack?
We’ve both been a bit flighty, but we’re going to be good
now. I’m going”—her blue eyes opened widely, and she
gave Jack a hearty hug—“to be a responsible person in
future. Drink, all of you. Drink to the health of a
pair of naughty children who are going to be good!”</p>

<p>It was not a bit as Claudia had planned it, but she
found herself obediently drinking the health of her
brother and sister-in-law in very bad and very sweet
champagne.</p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">“TWO IN A STUDIO”</span></h3>

<p>Two days later Claudia was wrinkling her brows
over her visiting-list, and sadly contemplating the
people she had been shunting, and who <em>must</em> be asked
to dinner, when she was surprised to hear Gilbert’s voice
outside the door. He had been confined to bed for the
last few days with a sharp attack of influenza, and
Neeburg had forbidden him to go out.</p>

<p>She rose and opened the door. Outside was her husband,
with his hat and coat on.</p>

<p>“Gilbert!”</p>

<p>“I’m going down to my chambers for an hour or two.
I’m sick of this coddling, and the only thing to do is to
work it off. It was a mistake to take to bed at all. I’m
convinced you bring on illnesses that way.”</p>

<p>“Come in a minute. Did Dr. Neeburg say you might
go?”</p>

<p>“No. Doctors always try and keep you in bed, and
Fritz is no better than the rest of them.”</p>

<p>His face was flushed and unhealthy in colour. His
eyes seemed more sombre than ever, and he was obviously
quite unfit to go out of the house.</p>

<p>“Gilbert, this is madness. Have you looked at yourself
in the glass? At least wait to see the doctor this
morning. Surely your work can wait for awhile, or one
of your clerks can come down as he did yesterday?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to be in court on a big case four days hence,
and all my books and things are down there. Lots of
people have influenza and don’t stop indoors. I’m strong;
I’ll soon throw the thing off if my mind is occupied.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>She did not know what to say. She knew it was very
unwise for him to go out, but, after all, she could not
force him to stay indoors. Neeburg had told her privately
that he was very much run down and needed a
good rest. Was it a good thing to tell a man he was not as
strong as he thought he was? Gilbert was always so proud
of his robust health, and so contemptuous of weaker men.
An old friend of his, a barrister, who often secured his
services, had recently had to go for a sea-voyage owing
to nerve-strain, and Gilbert had commented on it with a
complete lack of sympathy and understanding. People
who got ill easily he dubbed “weaklings.”</p>

<p>“Well, Gilbert,” she said gravely, “of course I can’t
make you keep to the doctor’s orders, but I do ask you
to give yourself a fair chance. You know”—tentatively—“you
have really been overworking for a long time,
and your constitution may be strong, but you can’t tax
it when you have an attack of influenza.”</p>

<p>“I’m all right,” he said rather truculently. “And I’m
going down in the car to a well-warmed room. It won’t
harm me, and I shall feel easier in my mind. I loathe
having nothing to do.”</p>

<p>She looked at him, and wondered what he would do
if he had a real long illness. The whole man was his
work, and his work was the man. He had practically
no hobbies, no pursuits, no amusements. When she had
married him he had been keen on golf, but even that he
had dropped.</p>

<p>Suddenly she said to him, “Do you ever wonder how I
spend my days, Gilbert?”</p>

<p>He looked at her in dull surprise. “Oh! women always
find something to do, don’t they? Dressmakers,
shopping, et cetera. Why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing. You know Frank Hamilton is painting
my portrait, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think you did tell me. Is it going to be good?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
He was obviously not very interested, and anxious to be
gone.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so, this time. But he needs a good many
sittings.... Do you like Frank Hamilton?”</p>

<p>“I never thought about it. Yes, I suppose he’s all
right for an artist. Well, I must go now. I daresay I
shan’t be away many hours.”</p>

<p>“Gilbert,” she said pleadingly, “don’t go. You are not
fit, really. If you don’t want to stop in bed, stay here
with me and read some books, or if your eyes hurt, I’ll
read to you. There’s such an amusing biography here.”</p>

<p>He shook her hand off his coat-sleeve and went towards
the door. “I’m too restless, Claudia. Tell Neeburg I
had to go.”</p>

<p>He was gone, and Claudia walked back to her desk.
Though various thoughts were buzzing through her head,
inflammatory, rebellious thoughts, she completed the list
of undesirables and requested the honour of their
company at dinner. Most of the stodgy ones were
friends of Gilbert’s family and good and worthy men
at the Bar, with their good and worthy wives.</p>

<p>At last Claudia laid down her pen and took up the
telephone. Frank’s voice answered her at the other end.</p>

<p>“I say, I told you I couldn’t come this afternoon for
the sitting. But I find I can, after all. Is it still convenient?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I’m delighted to hear it. I haven’t seen
you for three whole days—an eternity!”</p>

<p>“What a pretty speech!” mocked Claudia; “but I’ve
got the grain of salt here.”</p>

<p>“You can laugh at me if you like, but it only makes
things worse. I sometimes wonder if you are quite heartless.
Don’t you believe in any man?”</p>

<p>“Not—not if I can help it. Well, I’ll be with you
about three. I can’t talk now; I’m busy.”</p>

<p>But she sat for half an hour quite unoccupied, at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
she had no tangible occupation. She wrote no letters
and she sent no more invitations. The only thing she
did was to light a cigarette and stare out of the window
at the bare branches of the trees, just faintly beginning
to bud. And yet she was not thinking of the view, for
she looked for quite five minutes at the Albert Memorial,
and it was an edifice she loathed. Her face was set and
expressionless, only her eyes burned like live, glowing
coals in her head.</p>

<p>Rhoda Carnegie was lunching with her. She had rung
up earlier in the day and requested the meal, saying
quite frankly that a man had failed her and that she
wanted some decent food.</p>

<p>Claudia neither liked nor disliked her, she had got
used to her, for every now and then she had drifted into
the Iverson household.</p>

<p>Rhoda was late, but as Claudia knew her habits she
had ordered lunch a quarter of an hour later than usual.</p>

<p>“I’m late, dear. So sorry. But I put on six hats and
hated them all, so I’ve come out in the ugliest.” It was
a queer-shaped one, that showed the tip of her nose and
part of an ear.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you afraid you’ll get run over when you wear
a hat like that?” laughed Claudia.</p>

<p>“It does make the day seem gloomy, I admit. But a
hat like this intrigues a man. He doesn’t know what
else there is to it. There’s nothing like mystery about a
hat. Well, and how goes <i lang="fr">l’affaire Hamilton</i>?”</p>

<p>Claudia started to frown and then changed her mind.
Rhoda was not actively malicious, except when she hated
a rival, and a frown would be wasted on her.</p>

<p>“Oh! quite nicely,” she said coolly, inwardly a little
startled that it should have come to that. “I think the
picture will be a success this time.”</p>

<p>“Ah! if I were interested in a portrait-painter I
should certainly have my portrait painted, but that type<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
doesn’t appeal to me, and I hate having to talk art and
look at daubs that are not half as nice as the things they
represent. We hate one another most cordially. Two
<i lang="fr">poseurs</i> together, you know. It takes a <i lang="fr">poseur</i> to catch
a <i lang="fr">poseur</i>.”</p>

<p>Claudia stopped in the act of raising a glass of hock
to her lips. “You consider him a <i lang="fr">poseur</i>?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you spotted that?” drawled Rhoda. “I wish
I could afford a decent cook. No, you wouldn’t. You
think he has an artistic soul. I am certain he hasn’t.
But if you don’t rub the veneer too hard I daresay it
won’t come off while you are playing with it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why you call him a poseur,” returned
Claudia. “Unless you think we are all <i lang="fr">poseurs</i> and—well,
one has to wear clothing!”</p>

<p>“I’ll call it acting if you like it better. Wasn’t it
Meissonier who said, ‘Painters always have in them
something of the actor, they have the instinct for attitude
and gesture’? But he’s clever, he acts rather well.
So do I. And a pose is justified by its cleverness.”</p>

<p>She leaned forward on the table and smiled in her
hostess’s face.</p>

<p>“My dear, don’t think I am trying to say that his love
for you is a pose. But—well, naturally. You are very
handsome and an excellent companion. Shall I tell you
what he is <em>not</em>?”</p>

<p>“If you like,” said Claudia, with an affectation of
indifference.</p>

<p>“He is not working for art’s sake. He is not generous,
except to himself. He is not quite a gentleman—yes,
let me finish—either by birth or natural feeling. And he
is not—good enough for you, <i lang="fr">ma chère</i>.”</p>

<p>“There is hardly any question——” began Claudia
hotly.</p>

<p>“Claudia, don’t pretend. It’s not necessary with me.
I daresay he is more amusing than Gilbert, but still, he’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
not the right man. One’s husband is an accident; a
lover is sometimes—a mistake. After all, in spite of the
sweetest poodles and coon-can, love is the one thing that
interests women. But be careful with Frank Hamilton.
He is the sort of a man who gives a woman away, and
discretion is the first requisite for a lover.”</p>

<p>Claudia ignored the bigger issues. It was impossible
to snub Rhoda.</p>

<p>“You don’t like him, and therefore you are prejudiced,”
she replied, playing with a fat little quail on her
plate. “What do you know about him?”</p>

<p>“I know he is the son of a small country solicitor who
used to live at Salisbury. Now he lives in Kensal Green
Cemetery. His grandfather was the butcher of that
town, and I believe his grandfather wanted to put Frank
into his business, but——”</p>

<p>“Oh, Rhoda! don’t be ridiculous. Besides, what does
it matter what his grandfather was? You’re talking like
Lady Currey now. And it’s so old-fashioned!”</p>

<p>“Pooh! I don’t care about people’s ancestors, although
I think a butcher peculiarly unpleasing, let us say. Loinchops
and rumpsteaks are so prosaic. No, that isn’t the
point. He hasn’t got the innate feelings of a gentleman,
and with his upbringing he would let any woman down.
There are some things that men of the world with decent
breeding don’t do. And now tell me what the scandal
is about Lucy Morgan and the card that dropped on the
floor?”</p>

<p>At three, Claudia left Rhoda with the box of cigarettes—she
had already smoked five—and the latest thing in
novels, and went to Frank’s studio. She felt rather
self-conscious as she ascended the stairs, for now someone
had labelled it <i lang="fr">l’affaire Hamilton</i> it seemed to have
taken a different complexion. Well, other women were
all having flirtations, why not she? She had never
meant to; she recalled how she had looked on such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
affairs during her engagement—not with disgust, her
upbringing was against that, but she had been sorry for
the women who had to fill up their lives in underhand
ways. Life had looked so easy then, now she was beginning
to realize that life is most subtle, most complex,
most alluring and—most disappointing.</p>

<p>She involuntarily stopped and gave a delicate sniff as
she entered the studio. It was full of some over-sweet
perfume.</p>

<p>“Have you upset a bottle of perfume?” she asked.
“This is sweetness twice distilled.”</p>

<p>He went to the window hastily. “Don’t accuse me of
using perfume. One of my sitters.”</p>

<p>“Heavens! who uses such a perfume?”</p>

<p>He busied himself with the chair she was to sit in.
“Oh, you’ve met her. Mrs. Jacobs.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. J—— Oh, yes! the yellow lady with much
wealth. Well, you might make something odd and
bizarre out of her. But perhaps she wants to be depicted
as a blush-rose?”</p>

<p>“Don’t let’s talk about her. I don’t want to remember
any other woman when you are here.... No, that arm
isn’t quite right.” His hand was subtly caressing as he
bent it into the position required, and it sent a little
physical thrill through her. But when she met his eyes,
he saw only a mocking light in them. All the same, he
was quick to detect a slight difference in her attitude
towards him. After the episode of the drive home from
Hampstead he had been at first furiously angry, but
after a while her very elusiveness had intrigued him to
fresh efforts. His experience with women had been that
they were always rather shy when it came to the last
moves in the game; and Claudia was certainly a prize
in the feminine market.</p>

<p>“You don’t know the happiness it gives me to work
on your portrait.... Just look a little more to the left—a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
trifle more—yes, that’s right.... You must give me
the chance of finishing it. I shall be restless and unhappy
until it is done.... Don’t make me more unhappy
than I am already,” he concluded softly.</p>

<p>The studio was very warm—too warm, and the scent
still lingered in the air. It was an unpretentious apartment,
but it had not that bare, unclothed look which
distinguished some artists’ studios. Frank declared that
he worked better in a coloursome atmosphere, and he
had picked up some beautiful Oriental hangings, subdued
but rich, which draped the walls with dull gold and reds.
The few pieces of furniture were good. Frank had
bought them very cheaply from a former tenant.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why you should be unhappy,” answered
Claudia languidly, watching him mix some colours on his
palette. “Young and successful, that ought to be enough
to make a man happy.”</p>

<p>“Unsuccessful in the one thing that he really wants,”
replied the man at the easel, with a quick glance at her.</p>

<p>Claudia knew it was injudicious to continue in this
strain, but something within her, reckless and craving
for excitement, urged her on.</p>

<p>“We never get the things we really want. That
would be Paradise.... And what do you want so particularly?”</p>

<p>“What I am afraid there is no chance of gaining,” he
replied softly; “the heart of the dearest, most beautiful
woman in the world.”</p>

<p>“You want—a good deal.”</p>

<p>“Nothing less would content me.”</p>

<p>The studio was on the roof of a building in Victoria
Street and was reached by a long flight of stairs from
his living apartments below. Somewhere down there a
middle-aged, flat-footed woman acted as his servant, but
she never came into the studio unless Frank rang for
her. The sounds of the traffic made a dull, heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
grumbling below, but no other noise intruded upon them.</p>

<p>He looked at his sitter and he found her very desirable
and very beautiful, especially to-day, with that touch of
languor, that air of <i lang="fr">laisser faire</i>, as of one who lays
down the oars and deliberately lets the boat drift with
the current. Was it only a momentary mood? Did he
dare to say more?</p>

<p>She looked at the man, and she found him young and
very much alive, fully aware and appreciative of her
femininity.</p>

<p>Unconsciously she sighed.</p>

<p>In an instant he had thrown down the brushes and
was at her side, a light in his eyes, a look on his face
that made her shrink back a little and catch at the arms
of the chair.</p>

<p>“Claudia!”</p>

<p>She raised her eyebrows interrogatively.</p>

<p>He had dropped on his knees beside her chair—he
could do such things gracefully—and his lips were
pressed on the back of her hand, on her wrist, on her
soft forearm.</p>

<p>“Don’t, Frank, I——”</p>

<p>“Claudia, I worship you” he said recklessly. “You
must know it. Don’t keep me at arm’s length any longer.
You are driving me mad by your coldness. I can’t paint,
I can’t sleep.... I can only think of you as you might
be if you would let yourself love me.”</p>

<p>They had both risen to their feet, and he slipped his
arm persuasively round her shoulders. His nearness
seemed to deprive her of any will or any desire to repulse
him. Love is sweet, and his evident sincerity and passion
seemed to soothe some aching wound within her.
Was not this what she needed to make her life tolerable?
Every woman is entitled to love, and her marriage had
been a mistake. Perhaps, if she had known all she knew
now and she had met Frank earlier....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“Claudia, my dearest, say something to me.”</p>

<p>He drew her unresistingly to him, and the lids drooped
over her eyes as she felt the warmth of his breath on her
face and then the pressure of his lips.</p>

<p>There was none of the fierce masculinity and violence
of Gilbert’s early love-making. Frank Hamilton was too
much of an artist for that, and it was not the first time
he had made love to a fastidious, sensitive woman. He
gave her just the right impression, just the assurance
she needed at that moment of tender affection and almost
reverent passion. Had he been more virile in his love-making,
memory would have awakened, and with her
later knowledge she would have repulsed him. She
would have said to herself, “This is passion, <em>only</em> passion,
and I know what a little it means.” Suspicion would have
plucked at her sleeve. But Frank struck the right note,
partly by instinct, partly by design.</p>

<p>When at last she made a faint resistance to the pressure
of his arms, he slowly let her go, only to catch her
hands and cover them again with kisses. She looked
down at the waves of his dark hair, worn a little longer
than is usual, but not noticeably “artistic,” and she felt
sure that she cared for him. He had given a grateful
warmth to her heart. A glow of tenderness rose in her
for him.</p>

<p>“I think you are foolish to care so much for me,” she
said softly.</p>

<p>He drew her hands up till they rested on his shoulders,
and he smiled with happy contradiction into her face.
He was very good-looking in his triumph, and she could
not help rejoicing in his comeliness. The Greeks worshipped
beauty, and were they so wrong? Youth and
good looks ought to be part of love. Surely it is the
ideal.</p>

<p>“Now you look as I knew you could look,” he said
half dreamily; “your eyes are soft and velvety like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
petals of the pansy. I must kiss them once again ...
dear eyes ... beautiful eyes ... and I’ve looked into them
such a long time, hoping to see them soften and glow as
they do now. Claudia, if you knew how much I love you.”</p>

<p>“I wonder why,” she laughed, with the harmless
coquetry of the woman who knows herself loved, “when
there are such a number of women in the world.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t any woman comparable to you. I don’t
realize now that another woman exists on the face of the
earth. I feel as if you and I were standing on a desert
island. There are many people on the other islands, of
course, but not on ours.” He really meant it at the moment.</p>

<p>She pretended to laugh at his extravagance, but all the
time she felt that this was the way a man should love
a woman. Had she not felt like that when she had been
in love with Gilbert? The world had consisted of Gilbert—and
people. Of course, Frank loved her more than
she did him, but that somehow evened up things a little.
She had loved Gilbert more than he had loved her.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">he murmured.</p>

<p>“Then I saw the tombstones in the dark and their
message,” she interrupted, the scene in the motor recurring
to her.</p>

<p>“You saw——?”</p>

<p>“Nothing ... only don’t quote poetry; it makes everything
seem so unreal.”</p>

<p>“Unreal?” He caught her to him passionately. “Is
this unreal? Don’t you believe in my love?”</p>

<p>She let her head droop on his shoulder. “Men have
such large hearts—or such small ones. Don’t look so hurt,
dear.... It’s true. Men love and unlove so much more
easily than women.” But her lips smiled and took the
sting out of her words. The lips said, “I want to believe,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
while the worldly, cynical words flowed over them.
“What is fire to-day, Frank, is ashes to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“You don’t believe that love can last?”</p>

<p>His eyes shone, and he made a most convincing lover.
His voice had the right ring. She could feel the pulsating
warmth of his hand through the thin ninon of her sleeve.
“Claudia, you mean everything to me—everything. I
hardly dared to hope, and yet I had to, just as a ship-wrecked
sailor has to dream of land or he would die. I
have worked hard because I wanted to be worthy of your
praise, of your confidence. You have inspired everything
I have done. All the time I have been striving to please
<em>you</em>.”</p>

<p>It was balm to her, it was food for her heart’s hunger.
He had worked hard at his profession but to please her,
to lay his success as an offering at her feet—art, not for
art’s sake, but for love’s. That was the right romantic
spirit, a little <i lang="fr">exalté</i>, a little extravagant; but then, he
was an artist, and had not innumerable artists owed their
lives’ inspiration to women? She was glad she had been
able to help him, to introduce him into a circle that had
started the ball of success a-rolling for him. She had
been able to give and he had appreciated the giving, for
love always seeks self-immolation, and Claudia had
nothing of the vampire in her composition. Love! Did
she love him? Was it not inevitable after her first experience
that she should be a little uncertain of her
own feelings?</p>

<p>“I hoped, I prayed you would turn to me one day....
He doesn’t appreciate you. He takes your beauty and
your sweetness as his right. Everyone sees it.”</p>

<p>She was a little startled. So she and Gilbert’s marital
relations were being discussed just like other couples’
in their set. Gilbert’s coldness and neglect were being
talked about over the teacups of Mayfair. Her pride
revolted against it, and her half-formed determination to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
console herself like the other women she knew hardened.
Something that had been pricking her a little ceased to
do so. She would take the sweets offered her. After all,
life soon ended—in a tombstone. An epigram she had
heard a few days previously recurred to her mind: “Let
every woman see to it that she has a present, so that the
future may not find her unprovided with a past.” Who
cared about either her morals or her ethics? She had
only herself to reckon with. <em>Herself!</em> Well, she would
consider that another time.</p>

<p>“We won’t discuss him.... Never. You understand,
Frank?”</p>

<p>He had read the sudden tumult of her thoughts.</p>

<p>“You are still in love with him?” he said jealously.
“Of course, I know a woman like you must have married
for love. Tell me—you must answer me this one question,
then I will respect your wishes.... Are you?”</p>

<p>She did not hesitate, but she made a deliberate pause,
as though she were finally settling the question with her
own heart.</p>

<p>“No, I no longer love him, because the man I loved
does not exist.... Now go on with the picture. The
light will soon go, and I want to see it finished. Please.”</p>

<p>Reluctantly he went back to the easel and took up his
palette. She stood on the platform, watching him. He
caught her look and squared his shoulders.</p>

<p>“This is going to be my best picture,” he said enthusiastically.
“Love and beauty! Why, the very worst
artist would be inspired. I know I can do big things if
you encourage me.” He stopped, and then came back to
where she stood. “Claudia, you never acknowledged you
loved me. Say you do, dearest?”</p>

<p>His eyes were very beseeching and like a child’s, a
little distressed at the doubt that had flung its shadows
across his happiness.</p>

<p>“Claudia, you do love me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“I—I think I do, Frank. No, you must be content
with that at present.” She waved him back.</p>

<p>“But some day you will love me as I love you.” His
eyes were steady now, and the accent of the voice was
that of the conquering male.</p>

<p>She laughed a little uncertainly and a faint flush rose
to her cheeks.</p>

<p>“Shall I? Oh, what conceited creatures men are!
And—I don’t know how much you love me. A woman
never knows. Now go on with the portrait.”</p>

<p>As she went down in the lift some time later it stopped
at the second floor, and to her surprise the gate admitted
Colin Paton.</p>

<p>“You!” he exclaimed pleasantly. “And what are you
doing in Victoria Street?”</p>

<p>For a moment she had an unpleasant feeling of having
been caught doing something clandestine, and her reply
was a little embarrassed. She never remembered to have
felt quite so before.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you know that Mr. Hamilton’s studio is up at
the top? The portrait, you know.”</p>

<p>She was very annoyed with herself for the feeling,
and went on quickly:</p>

<p>“It was you who begged me to continue the sittings.
So I have been trying to please you. But it’s very tiresome.”</p>

<p>She wondered what made her tack on the last sentence
even as she uttered it. Was it because she feared that
his keen eyes would note her embarrassment? Why did
she have to be a hypocrite? She was glad when the lift
stopped and the bright electric light ceased to shine on
her face. The street was grey and more kindly.</p>

<p>“Beauty must be penalized some way or another,” he
rejoined smilingly. “Some women would be only too glad
to put up with the boredom should a well-known portrait-painter
beg them to sit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>She arranged her veil and looked round for her motor.</p>

<p>“You don’t know his work, do you?”</p>

<p>The fresh air of the street was refreshing after the
enervating atmosphere of the studio.</p>

<p>“I saw some of his pictures the other day at a show.
It’s clever work.”</p>

<p>“Not more than that?” Her tone implied that his
praise was too tepid.</p>

<p>“Does it quite satisfy you?”</p>

<p>She was feeling vaguely irritated at the encounter.
Why did he make her feel uncomfortable, and why did
he belittle Frank’s work? He was usually generous in
his praise. Had he any suspicion with regard to their
friendship? She answered untruthfully, with a touch
of defiance:</p>

<p>“Yes, I think it quite satisfies me.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re a good judge. Perhaps I’ve lost my
taste for pictures in the Argentine. Big spaces are apt
to make you rather intolerant of some so-called ‘artistic’
achievements. Genius always stands out, but talent
somehow gets awfully dwarfed. Don’t you know what I
mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re not in the Argentine. We’re in Victoria
Street.” No, she would not admit that Frank had only
talent.</p>

<p>He laughed and dropped the subject. “I know it well
by the roar of the buses. I met a fellow out there who
was desperately homesick, and he confided to me that
he’d give anything to see the scavengers washing down
the street as he drove home from the club, and see the
wet pavement shining under the street lamps. How’s
Gilbert to-day?”</p>

<p>“He has gone to his chambers.”</p>

<p>“What? Why, he was in bed yesterday.”</p>

<p>“I know.” She shrugged her shoulders under their
luxurious furs. “But the only thing that counts with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Gilbert is his work, you know. He refuses to stop in bed
any longer.” She looked him straight in the face and
her eyes were bright and hard. “Tell me something.
Did you always know that work is the only real thing in
Gilbert’s life? But, of course, you knew. You see most
things in your quiet, undemonstrative way.”</p>

<p>They were standing beside the car. The door was
open for her to step into it.</p>

<p>For a moment he was nonplussed. What answer could
he make to such a question? But while he was groping
for some words, she held out her hand with a little
amused, cynical laugh.</p>

<p>“Yes. I see you did know. You need not tell a
lie. I think you might have warned me. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>She left him standing on the pavement, his grey eyes
troubled and anxious.</p>

<p>She leaned back and tried to think of Frank and the
difference his love was going to make in her life. She
tried to give herself up again to the pleasant feeling of
being cared for, of being appreciated. She tried to recapture
the thrill his caresses had given her; but she could
not. She could only see the troubled grey eyes of Colin
Paton.</p>

<p>“He’s spoilt my afternoon,” she said angrily to herself
as the car sped homewards. “He’s spoilt my afternoon.
And he is only a dreamer. He has no right to
judge me.”</p>

<p>But Colin Paton was not the judge.</p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smaller">“MELTON GREEN”</span></h3>

<p>“She’s so keen on your coming,” urged Jack. “She’s
taken a tremendous fancy to you. And, you know,
she’s such a kid. She’s no end proud of her turn. You
<em>must</em> come and see her.”</p>

<p>“You are aware that my august husband will be very
displeased should he hear of it,” returned Claudia dryly.</p>

<p>“Oh! blow Gilbert and his airs! I can’t think how
you came to marry such a sack of sawdust. I met him
yesterday and he was as frigid as a frozen leg of mutton....
What’s it got to do with him whom I marry?”</p>

<p>A good constitution will stand a great deal, and, contrary
to expectations, Gilbert had not had to return
ignominiously to bed after his rash defiance of the
doctor’s orders. But he had never recovered, and Claudia
saw that he was not half the man he had been. But he
would not admit that he felt ill, and his secret feelings
only showed themselves in great irritability and an almost
total ignoring of her presence.</p>

<p>“If people minded their own business,” said Claudia
lightly, “this world would be a dull place! It’s family
friction that keeps us all alive!”</p>

<p>“Rot! But Gilbert is too priggish for words. I always
did hate the Curreys, anyway, and Gilbert was ever a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
cold-blooded fish.” He cast a curious glance at his
sister, which she ignored. Sometimes in a dull, unimaginative
way he wondered how far emotion now
played its part in her marriage. But he never asked
questions, for he was a little afraid of Claudia. “I say,
come along to-night. It’s Saturday, and that’s a good
night. You’ve never seen anything like the Empire at
Melton Green on a Saturday, I bet.”</p>

<p>“I half promised to make a four at the club,” said
Claudia indifferently, stroking Billie’s ears. “But Melton
Green sounds amusing.”</p>

<p>Gilbert had gone down for the week-end to his parents,
always a tiresome function to her, and this time he had
not urged her to accompany him.</p>

<p>“That’s nothing. I insist on your coming. We’ll dash
back to the West End between the shows and get something
to eat. Do, Claud, old girl; I want you to see how
popular she is. Why, the gallery boys fairly eat her.”</p>

<p>“How much is the gallery?”</p>

<p>“Oh! threepence admission.” Jack grinned. “They
are a crew, too. They’ll amuse you. You look a bit
down in the mouth. Fay’ll cheer you up. You can’t be
blue with her.”</p>

<p>“I’m not down in the mouth,” contradicted his sister
untruthfully. “One can’t always be howling with
laughter. Life isn’t as funny as all that.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t know. That’s the worst of you brainy
people. You take life too seriously. What on earth is
the good of rootling about and trying to find a deep
meaning in everything? There isn’t any meaning in life.
You’re just put here to enjoy yourself. A cabbage doesn’t
think. Why should we?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know your theory of life, or rather, your lack
of one.” Frank had been insinuating the same philosophy
at their various meetings. She was aware that the insinuating
process had an ulterior motive, for she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
unable to deceive herself or walk blindly into the arms
he held out to her. But so far she had kept him off very
delicate ground. She knew she could not do so much
longer, and she wondered at herself that she did not
capitulate. For more and more her thoughts dwelt on
those pleasures of which she had been deprived. The
spring air tantalized her and made the blood run hotter
in her veins. Nature craved its proper food; youth
seconded its demands.</p>

<p>“Chuck this analytical business and take life lightly,”
urged her brother. “I take life lightly and so does Fay.
She’s a perfect skylark. Doesn’t look a day ahead or a
day backwards.”</p>

<p>“And you counsel me to do likewise—to emulate her
mode of living?”</p>

<p>He was lounging in the library of her flat, content with
himself and all the world. He had borne a lot of “chipping”
on his marriage, which was now dying down. But
in spite of his lethargic egotism, he caught a look now
in Claudia’s eyes that made his dull brain work a little.
What had some woman been saying about Claudia and
some painter chap? He tried to recall the gossip, but it
had been late at night and his recollection was vague.</p>

<p>“In moderation, old girl,” he counselled warily. “Of
course there are some things you can’t do. But flutter
a bit if you like.”</p>

<p>“What sort of things can’t I do?” asked Claudia, with
abrupt directness.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t peg me down! Well, things I can do, you
can’t. A girl’s different from a man—at least, you
are.”</p>

<p>“The old shibboleth!” she jeered. “We’re not
different, my dear brother. We’re exactly the same,
only—only I suppose we’re more fastidious.”</p>

<p>He was a little alarmed. In the old days Claudia had
always taken what he called “a high moral tone” in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
discussing his little peccadilloes. Vaguely he felt that
this change in her was not right.</p>

<p>“Is Fay conservative in her opinions on this subject?”
went on Claudia, with a touch of cruelty. “Does
she think there are things she can do and you can’t?”</p>

<p>He winced and uncrossed his legs. “She’s different
from you,” he said decidedly. “You’re sort of—well,
superior. I’d hate to think——” He stopped and
tweaked Billie’s ear.</p>

<p>“Well, go on. What would you hate?”</p>

<p>Billie looked at him sadly as he twisted his lips about.
“Well, er—oh! you know the things I wouldn’t like
you to do. For some women it’s all right, not for you....
You see, well, with some women it doesn’t seem
to matter, it’s natural for them to do a bit of straying,
but it’s not natural for you, and”—with unexpected
acuteness—“it would make you miserable. You’d hate
the game, because you’d see through the whole bally
business, and you’d criticize yourself and him.”</p>

<p>“You’re talking of a mere flirtation,” returned Claudia
quickly. “A liaison between a man and a woman may
be something more than that. What, after all, is a gold
band on the finger and a mumbling clergyman?”</p>

<p>“Course, if you put it that way, I can’t answer you.
But I don’t say it’s different, only—well, they nearly
all are flirtations of varying degrees of warmth. You
don’t mean much to her, and she doesn’t mean much
to you, but you pretend all the time. Of course”—vaguely—“there
are <i lang="fr">grandes passions</i>, like Shakespeare’s
people, but they don’t grow on every gooseberry-bush.
And I ought to know, you know.” He made the last
remark quite simply, just as he might have complimented
himself on his taste in ties.</p>

<p>“You haven’t looked for love,” she said sharply.
“Love may come at any moment in your life, and I
think you deny it—at your own risk.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>“Besides, Gilbert would make a hell of a row,” observed
her brother. “A hell of a row.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t talking of myself. We were merely arguing
in—in a general way.”</p>

<p>He looked at her in silence, and she turned away,
biting her lip. Then she rose with a little dry laugh.
The one man of all those she knew whose tolerance she
would have taken for granted had failed to back her up.
Why should she be different from other neglected wives?
Why should she go through life hungry and miserable?
Suddenly she turned in surprise at Jack’s next remark.</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t Colin Paton get married? He’s a nice
chap. Everyone speaks well of him.”</p>

<p>“Colin? Oh! I don’t think he cares for women that
way.”</p>

<p>Jack gave a lazy chuckle. “All men care for women
that way—when they can get ’em. Why didn’t you
marry him Claud? Why did you give him the go-by?”</p>

<p>“The go-by?” she said incredulously. “Why, he never
wanted to marry me. We were only—friends, the best
of friends.”</p>

<p>“I read somewhere in something that friendship is a
good foundation for marriage. What was the beastly
quotation? ‘Love is friendship set on fire.’ It impressed
me, because Fay and I were awful good chums for
a long time and we never—never till we were
married.”</p>

<p>He said it in a shamefaced way, like a schoolboy convicted
of saying his prayers. His face had gone a curious
pink, and he avoided meeting Claudia’s eyes.</p>

<p>But she was not thinking of his confession, she was
thinking of Colin Paton. Why had he not married?
Was her easy explanation the right one? Why, no, he
had never wanted to marry her.</p>

<p>“You don’t imagine Colin Paton wanted to marry me,
do you?” she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I shouldn’t have been surprised if you and he
had fixed it up. You used to go about a lot together,
and you’re not a woman a man would feel platonically
about. I thought he went away so hurriedly because of
your engagement. But, of course, you know him much
better than I.”</p>

<p>She found the thought curiously interesting and a little
exciting, even while she tried to dismiss it. He had
never said a word that could be construed into love-making.
Surely there would have been some word or
look that would have betrayed him if it were as Jack
suggested.</p>

<p>Jack looked at his watch. “By Jove, we must go if
we’re going. Come along, old girl, she’s on in the first
house at eight, and it’s a long drive down there. It’s
the wilds of beyond, over the river. Go and put on
something quiet and oldish. There’s a good deal of dust
knocking about behind the scenes.”</p>

<p>The drive was, as he had said, a long one, through
narrow streets and past huge lumbering tramcars that
were new to Claudia. The streets during the latter part
of the journey were lined with roadside stalls illuminated
by flaring naptha lamps that cast weird shadows over
faces that reminded her of those in Dickens’ novels.
There were barrows with all kinds of china, stalls brilliantly
red with joints of meat, others piled high with
greenstuff and with trays of toffee and sweets. It seemed
to Claudia that she had never heard so many hoarse,
raucous voices before, punctuated every now and then
by the pipe of some child trying to make itself heard
among the tumult. Between the activities of the stalls
they passed rows of grey, grimy little houses, timber-yards
and factories, brightly-lit public houses, and always
the trams, still more brilliant, gliding along full of passengers,
like great ships in full sail.</p>

<p>She and Jack did not talk intimately any more. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
listened to his account of a big golfing competition. Only
once did he revert to their previous conversation. It
came up apropos of Jack saying that Colin Paton had
been in up to the last round.</p>

<p>“He plays such a good, steady game. Upon my word,
I like to watch him. I say, Claudia, if it were he, instead
of this painter chap, I wouldn’t mind. But, then, he’s
Gilbert’s friend, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>Claudia was spared any reply by the stoppage of their
car outside a brightly-lit theatre with placards galore.
She noticed at once several of The Girlie Girl in various
costumes and various smiles. It was not one of the new
suburban halls, but there was plenty of light on the
frontage.</p>

<p>“Got to find the stage-door,” said Jack. “Here,
perhaps this is it, up this alley.”</p>

<p>The alley was dark and very dirty and Claudia held
up her skirts fastidiously. A boy, with a jug in his
hand, came running down while they were half-way, and
a man with a clay pipe came out of a grimy, narrow
door at the end.</p>

<p>It was the stage-door. Claudia almost shrank back
when she saw the narrow passage way with its blackened
walls and filthy staircase, which she found she was expected
to descend. The atmosphere was indescribable,
frowsy, hot and stale. The strains of the orchestra
reached them intermittently as the doors below were
opened and shut.</p>

<p>“You’ll find her down there,” called out the door-keeper
encouragingly. “She ain’t on yet.”</p>

<p>The boy had returned with the beer-jug, and the beer
was being slopped on the stairs as he shoved his way
past them. A curious roaring sound was in progress
now, and it took Claudia a little time to realize that it
was applause from the front of the house.</p>

<p>She followed Jack down the stairs, and she saw that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the dirtiness of his surroundings did not embarrass him.
Evidently he was used to them. The steps were of stone
and the railings were iron, and it seemed to Claudia
like some curious sort of dirty prison, rather than a hall
of gaiety.</p>

<p>They arrived at the bottom of the stairs, and looking
up from the stone steps on which she was afraid her feet
might slip, she got rather a shock. Standing talking excitedly
were three acrobats with the minimum of clothing,
the perspiration pouring down over their make-up. It
was certainly Nature in the raw, and hardly a pleasant
sight at close quarters. The muscles were standing out
on their arms and chests, and for the first time Claudia
realized the work involved in such performances, which
she usually sat through indifferently. One of them hailed
Jack enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“Hallo! old man! Fay was asking if we’d seen you.”
They cast a curious but not very interested glance at
Claudia. “Come into our room and have a drink later on.”</p>

<p>Jack nodded, and Claudia followed him along another
few yards of the passage. It struck her that most of the
dirt had been made by human fingers and bodies, for
above the height of five feet or so the walls were comparatively
clean. They passed an open door where a
stout woman in chemise and petticoat was making-up in
a public manner before a looking-glass, and then she
found herself in Fay’s dressing-room.</p>

<p>It was a small slip of a room, with flaring gas-jets
protected by wire shades and two washing-basins inset in
the table-shelf which went across one side of it. The
heat in the room took Claudia’s breath away; it was even
worse than the passages. The light was almost cruelly
bright. There were three huge dress-baskets, which
almost filled the apartment, and a lumpy, perspiring and
heavily-breathing dresser was sitting on one of them,
sewing on something spangled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>A man was just finishing speaking in a heavy, oily
voice as Fay’s husband pushed open the door, and Claudia
was in time to hear Fay say, in accents of excitement and
pleasure: “Jim, you’re a perfect duck. I love diamonds
and rubies. Come here and let me give you another kiss
for it.”</p>

<p>So it happened that Claudia’s second view of Fay was
one with her arms flung round something masculine, standing
on the tips of her toes to do so. Two brawny arms
were returning her hug. She felt Jack stiffen a little as
Fay broke loose with a laugh.</p>

<p>“It’s almost like old times. Oh! but I mustn’t remember
them now. I promised.... Here he is. Jack,
come in. I want to introduce you to Jim Clerry—my
husband.”</p>

<p>There was not the faintest touch of confusion in Fay’s
manner or face, any more than with a child who has been
caught bestowing embraces. She was evidently very
pleased over something. She was radiant with good
humour.</p>

<p>The man, who thrust out his hand and said, “Glad to
know you sir,” was, in spite of his name, an obvious
Jew, with heavy, coarse features and almost negroid lips.
The face was only redeemed by the brightness of the dark
eyes. To Claudia’s artistic sense it was almost revolting
that any pretty woman should kiss him, especially anything
so dainty as Fay. She wondered, indeed, that any
woman could wish to do so.</p>

<p>In an artificial way, for she was heavily made-up, Fay
was looking her prettiest. Her great blue eyes sparkled
under the bunch of pale blue ostrich feathers on her head
which, with some kind of a gold-lace cap, constituted her
head-dress.</p>

<p>“Now, boys, I want you to be friends,” called out
Fay, picking up a hare’s foot and giving another rub to
her red cheeks. “I say, what’s the time? Have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
performing dogs finished? Oh! Jack, why didn’t you tell
me?” She rushed over impetuously to the doorway and
pulled Claudia in. “My dear, this <em>is</em> nice of you.
I <em>am</em> glad to see you. Sit on this basket. But I wish
you hadn’t come to this hall. I generally do much more
classy halls than this, but I have to do this on an old
contract. I’m working ’em all off now. I wish I were
doing ‘The Monkey and the Moth’ to-night. Have you
heard it? No? Oh! it’s a ripping song. Perhaps I’ll
do it at the second house. Oh! I’m forgetting my manners—never
shall be a real lady—Mr. Clerry, Mrs. Currey,
my sister-in-law. Isn’t she lovely?”</p>

<p>A knotted, hairy and none too clean hand came towards
her and shook hers like a pump-handle.</p>

<p>“Good looks run in the family, I should say,” with
what, to Claudia, was an offensive chuckle. “Well, I’ll
’op it, Fay. No room for an old mash now. Congrats
on your marriage. I daresay you were wise to chuck me.
Anyway, I bear no grudge. So long. Ta-ta, everyone.”</p>

<p>“Jim, don’t be a fool!” cried Fay, standing on one foot
like a stork while the dresser laced some ribbons round
her leg. “You must wait and see my turn.”</p>

<p>“Got to see a man at the Kilburn Empire. Only came
along to give you that toy. Ta-ta. Be good, and you’ll
be happy.”</p>

<p>With a comprehensive nod he went out, with a curious
swaggering, swaying movement of the shoulders and hips.</p>

<p>“Come and see us at the flat,” shouted Fay, standing
on the other leg. Then to Claudia: “He’s the best clog
dancer on the Moss and Stoll tour. He’s out this week
because of the fire last week.”</p>

<p>A jeweller’s morocco case lay at her elbow, and Jack
looked at it suspiciously.</p>

<p>“What’s that, Fay?”</p>

<p>She opened it with great glee. “The duckiest pendant
you ever saw.” It was a showy but rather expensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
affair. “It’s jolly nice of Jim under the circs. I’ll wear
it to-night for luck.”</p>

<p>Jack took the case away from her. “Fay, you can’t
accept this. You’re my wife now. Don’t you see it
isn’t—isn’t the thing. I’ll give you all the pendants you
want.”</p>

<p>The blue eyes opened at first in surprise and then grew
dark and stormy. Her mouth took a curve that spoilt its
prettiness.</p>

<p>“Give it back to me at once or you and me’ll have a
row. Why, they’re real diamonds and rubies. He told
me he paid twenty-five quid for it wholesale. Think
you’re going to chuck it in the dust-bin?” Her voice had
grown a little shrill. Claudia wished she were anywhere
rather than in the same room, but the dresser looked on
with frank interest, “a bit of a row” evidently enlivening
her profession for her.</p>

<p>“I shan’t chuck it in the dust-bin,” said Jack a little
sulkily. “You’ve got to send it back to him. She must,
mustn’t she, Claudia?”</p>

<p>“Not much, my dear. And have him give it to some
other girl? After all, I’ve a right to it. We were great
pals. I hear he’s taken up with Molly Billington, and I
won’t see it hung round her fat neck. She’s a beast!
Why shouldn’t he give me a wedding-present?”</p>

<p>She made a sudden snatch that reminded Claudia of
a velvet-pawed cat, and regained possession of it. With a
laugh of triumph she put it round her neck.</p>

<p>“I’ll wear it to-night for luck.” Her good temper had
come back. She danced up to her husband, who was
standing moodily regarding the mess of make-up materials
spread on a towel, and held up her lips to him.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a loony, Jackie boy. It’s all over and done
with if you’re feeling jealous. I’m good now. I won’t
take anything more from him. Kiss me.” Yelps and
howls suddenly assailed their ears. “There! the dogs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
have finished. Kiss me like a good boy and I’ll forgive
you.” She looked up into his face with a delicious <i lang="fr">moue</i>
and wink. “I never said any of your girls were not to
give you presents, though I’d fire them out of the flat
quick enough. I say ‘Live and let live.’ Come on.”</p>

<p>The tempting mouth and laughing eyes were too much
for Jack, and he did as she requested, though with a
rueful look at Claudia that she thought it better to pretend
not to see.</p>

<p>“Hope my voice is all right to-night. I ate a lot of
bloater-paste for tea, and that dries up the voice. Don’t
you find that? Only it’s a weakness of mine. Mar used
to say I was weaned on bloater-paste.” She looked in
the glass anxiously. “Perkins, a wee drop of stout.
La—la—la—la!” She took the scale with terrific force
in the small space. “Come in.” This in answer to a
knock at the door. The fat woman whom they had seen
next door came hurtling in. Her toilette was a little
more advanced, but not much.</p>

<p>“I say, dearie, have you heard about Gertie Lockhart?
She’s got the rheumatic fever, and they say she won’t
be able to work for months. We’re getting up a little
sub. for her. Give me a few bob, my dear.”</p>

<p>“I should think so,” said Fay emphatically. “Perkins,
find my purse. I heard she was pretty bad. Rotten
luck! Here’s half a quid with my love. Oh! Miss Belle
de Laney—Mrs. Currey. You’ve met my husband,
haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Charmed to meet you, I’m sure. Fay, where did you
get them feathers? I’ve been looking out for some like
that for weeks. I’ve got such a cold I can hardly speak.
Old Moser’s a bit screwed to-night, ain’t he? Thanks
muchly, old girl. My! I wish I could keep my fat down
like you. Once upon a time—yes, it sounds like a fairy-tale,
don’t it?—I had legs like hers. Couldn’t fill my
stockings out properly. Now it’s out-sizes, and the holes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
I wear in ’em!” She nodded confidentially to Claudia.
“Do you know, I used to play Columbine once; then
I got to principal boy, and now—well, look at me!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry,” said Fay kindly. “You’ve got a
fine figure, and no one’ll overlook you. And your song’s
a treat, a fair treat. Got three curtains last night, didn’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Glad you like it. There’s a rattling good ’ouse
to-night. See you later, Fay.”</p>

<p>“Used to be one of the prettiest girls on the halls,”
explained Fay, as Miss Belle de Laney vanished; “used
to know my mother. She’s a good sort, too. Husband’s
a swine, and won’t do no work, and she keeps him and
four kids, and makes no growl about it either. Now,
Jack, I’m on in a few minutes. Take your sister round
to the front. Old Moser’ll put you in a box ... la, la, la,
la.... H’m!... How do I look? Knock ’em in the Old
Kent Roadish? Emerald green and orange, my own idea.
Got it from seeing some oranges lying with the spinach
in the kitchen. Bit of shick, ain’t it? See the saucy
garters?” She suddenly bestowed a hug upon Claudia.
“I like you no end. I watched you just now, and you
didn’t turn up your nose at Belle. Of course, she’s as
common as dirt, I know that. Still, I believe in good
hearts. We’re going to be real sisters, aren’t we? You
can teach me the ways of high society, because I don’t
want the boy to be ashamed of me. I’ll catch on quick
enough if you’ll only give me a few tips, and I can keep
my mouth shut if I want to.” She turned with a characteristically
quick gesture—she reminded Claudia of an
active robin—and caught Jack by the lapels of his
coat.</p>

<p>“You’re not angry with me, Jumbo, are you? What
does it matter?”</p>

<p>“I’m not exactly angry,” said Jack, looking into her
face, “only, don’t you see, things are different now, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
a—a man—can’t give jewellery—to a lady who is—is the
wife of another man.”</p>

<p>She raised her eyebrows. “Moses in the bulrushes!
why not? Most women would like to get the chance
of having pendants. It’s a souvenny, Jack, for luck.
And it’s so pretty. I’m straight now all right, so it don’t
mean nothing. Crikey! that’s his second song. I must
go down. Perkins, give me my coat. Here”—she rushed
back again to the table and thrust a bunch of carnations
into Claudia’s hand—“throw these down to me. It
looks well. See you afterwards.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smaller">“THE STAR TURN.”</span></h3>

<p>Claudia had never been behind the scenes of a
theatre, and she found the <i lang="fr">va et vient</i>, the bustle and
hurry of a music-hall almost bewildering, so that she
received the vaguest impressions of her journey through
to the front. She felt, rather than saw, the gloomy floor
space behind the set littered with properties, all looking
very ludicrous and childish. A man was evidently doing
a song and patter turn to judge from the guffaws from
the front of the house. She could see above her head
men up in the flies controlling the limelight and the curtain,
all of whom were in their shirt-sleeves. In fact,
Jack was the only conventionally dressed person she had
seen since she entered the theatre.</p>

<p>She was hurried along to a small door, which she found
gave access to the house—Jack was evidently known to
the man in charge, who nodded familiarly and called him
“Capting”—and having descended some dusty, red-covered
steps, she found herself suddenly in a little box
in full view of the audience. Her first impression was
that she had never seen so many people so tightly squeezed
together before, and so intent on the comedian with the
red nose and battered silk hat who was holding forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
from the middle of the stage. All the theatres she had
ever seen had been more or less roomy, but these people
reminded her of an old-fashioned solid bouquet, except
that there was practically no colour in the house. In a
West-End theatre various bits of colour strike the eye,
especially in the stalls and dress-circle; but as the curtain
descended to great applause she saw that the house was
a study in black and white—the clothing black, the faces
white. There must have been some bits of colour, but
they did not show. Her second impression was that she
had never before realized how toiling humanity in a mass
can smell. It was the odour of toil and scanty bathing,
mingled with the inevitable orange and the reek of gas.</p>

<p>A number went up in the slot at the side—twelve—the
star turn of the evening, The Girlie Girl.</p>

<p>The orchestra struck up one of her popular songs, and
the audience, and especially the gallery boys—they
looked to Claudia as though they were hanging on the
ceiling by their eyelashes like flies—began to cheer and
beat time to the music. She happened to glance at Jack,
and she was amused to see a complacent smile taking the
place of the dumbly-worried look he had been wearing
since the episode of the pendant.</p>

<p>“They adore her,” he whispered. “She believes in
making friends with the gallery boys. She says it’s the
secret of her success.... I say, Claud, what could I
do about that beastly pendant? She doesn’t see things
as we do. She’s like a blessed babe, or a savage, in some
things.”</p>

<p>A huge burst of cheering stopped any further conversation,
and Claudia found herself looking down at her
sister-in-law laughing and kissing her hands to the gallery.
In the limelight she looked extraordinarily pretty and
alive, and there was no man present that could have
failed to see the <i lang="fr">gamine</i> charm of her, though he might
not have wanted to espouse her. Her blue eyes laughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
in a friendly fashion at the house and her pretty feet
began to dance to the measure while she waved aloft a
sort of d’Orsay walking-stick tied up with green and
orange ribbons.</p>

<p>Her voice, though sweet—unusually sweet for the
music-halls—was nothing wonderful, and Claudia detected
already signs of hard wear. She had a few particularly
good notes in her top register, but it was not
for her voice that she was so applauded. There was an
air of infectious gaiety, a “I-like-you-and-you-like-me”
camaraderie that made the vapid song and words—how
incredibly bad the words were!—seem amusing.</p>

<p>The song was all about a ladybird and a rose in an
old-fashioned garden. The rose was sweet and innocent,
and the ladybird “knew a bit.” It was neither funny
nor frankly improper; but the audience roared with
laughter, especially when she completed each verse with
a huge wink. At the end of the song she threw a kiss
deliberately up to their box, which made the entire audience
turn and look at them, and reduced Claudia to a
state of helpless and fiery embarrassment.</p>

<p>“All right, boys, it’s my husband,” called out the Girlie
Girl, with a chuckle, as she departed into the wings.
There followed a burst of yelling, cat-calling and clapping,
with cries of “Good luck!” “Send us a bit of cake,
Girlie,” “Keep him in order,” “Wish you joy!”</p>

<p>Claudia was sorry she had not put on a veil or a more
shady hat. She knew that her face was scarlet. She
had never been in such a scene in her life, and she took
no pleasure in being conspicuous at any time. Jack was
looking sheepish, but evidently he was more used to such
things.</p>

<p>The audience went on singing the chorus of her last
song while Fay was changing in the wings. Then the
orchestra struck up another tune as she appeared in a
smart little <i lang="fr">vivandière</i> costume of blue, with red facings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
and a cap that was stuck coquettishly sideways on her
huge bunch of curls. This time she led the singing of
the chorus from the stage, every now and then ceasing to
sing herself, and beating time with encouraging gestures
to the rather hoarse, flat voices of the crowd. It was a
wonderful sight to Claudia, who was so fascinated that
she forgot her embarrassment and leaned forward. As
she looked round the house all the lips seemed moving—men
and women, boys and children.</p>

<p>The audience would not part with her, and after taking
eight curtains she came back to sing the last verse once
more.</p>

<p>“Now boys, I want you to sing <em>loudly</em> this time. Let’s
raise the roof and take the slates off. Shan’t be coming
to Milton Green for a long time. Don’t whisper—<em>sing</em>.
All of you sing, Tom and Bill, and Kate and Mary. Sing
out as you would if you got your wages doubled to-morrow.
Now....”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I’m one of the King’s little drummer-boys,</div>
<div class="verse">And I serve....”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The packed audience positively yelled, and Fay laughing,
kept on encouraging them with remarks:</p>

<p>“Go it, boys!... It’s a cure for sore throats....
Get it off your chests.... Bill, you’re not opening your
mouth wide enough; no flies to-night.... Mary, a
bit louder....”</p>

<p>Then how the tragedy happened no one ever quite
understood. Fay was laughing and kissing her little
hands up to the gallery, as alive as a piece of quicksilver,
when the heavy curtain came down suddenly, and before
anyone could shout, struck her. Claudia, who had risen
in horror, caught a look of almost childish surprise in the
blue eyes before Fay lay flattened out on the ground
the two pretty arms thrown out helplessly in front of her,
the curtain, as it were, cutting her in two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>For a moment there was a horrible awed hush; then a
woman in the audience gave vent to a piercing shriek,
and immediately a tumult of cries and shouts filled the
auditorium. Claudia, who had been almost stunned by
the suddenness of the thing, had just time to see the men
fighting their way to the front, apparently with some
vague idea of raising the curtain off the little body,
when she saw the curtain move up a few inches and half
a dozen hands gently drag the body behind it. She
turned to Jack. He was staring down at the stage, his
face ashen grey, his eyes starting out of his head. But
he made no movement to go to his wife.</p>

<p>“Jack,” she panted, “we must go round. Quick!
Don’t you want to get to her?”</p>

<p>Still he did not move, nor did he seem to hear her. He
was still staring down at the stage.</p>

<p>“Jack!” she shook his arm. “Rouse yourself! Come
quick!”</p>

<p>He seemed to awaken with a shudder, and she drew
him into the shadow of the box.</p>

<p>“I can’t,” he said, with dry lips and shaking from
head to foot. “I can’t.... Is she dead?”</p>

<p>Claudia was unaware of the great weight of the curtain,
and tried to speak encouragingly.</p>

<p>“No, no, of course not.... Jack, you must go to her.”</p>

<p>“I can’t stand things like that,” he whispered, passing
his hand over his clammy forehead. “You know I never
could.... Oh, my God! she’s dead! Fay’s dead, and I
saw her killed!”</p>

<p>Claudia remembered that he never could stand ugly
sights or any kind of illness or decay. His ordinary good-nature
entirely deserted him at such times. He had refused
to go and see an old schoolfellow in his last illness,
and had always tried to escape visiting his grandmother,
who had died slowly of cancer.</p>

<p>“Jack, you <em>must</em>!” cried Claudia hotly, propelling him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
to the door. “Don’t be a coward. Perhaps she’s only
stunned and wants you. You’ve got to play the man,
or I’ll never speak to you again.”</p>

<p>Even the biting contempt in her voice did not rouse
him; but he allowed himself to be dragged like one in a
dream through the door and up the red stairs.</p>

<p>“For the sake of your manhood and the honour of
the Iversons, if not for poor Fay, pull yourself together,”
said Claudia sharply, as they stepped upon the stage.</p>

<p>A group of men were bending down over something
that had been laid on a pile of coats. Others were crowding
together, talking in excited, frightened whispers.
The stout lady came rushing on the stage, sobbing hysterically
and wringing her red hands. The orchestra commenced
to play again.</p>

<p>A man came pushing his way after them through the
door from the auditorium. Accustomed as she was to
the conventional garb of West End physicians, Claudia
was surprised to hear this man in a pepper-and-salt suit
say: “I’m a doctor. Let me go to her.”</p>

<p>Jack was still dazed. With a last glance of contempt at
him, Claudia went forward and took command of the
situation. “Please, doctor, do all you can. I am her
sister-in-law. Tell me what we should do.”</p>

<p>She followed him towards the little group, inwardly
shrinking and desperately frightened, but outwardly
calm and collected. She stood with the stage hands, as
one of them. She could see by their faces that they feared
a bad verdict.</p>

<p>Various hoarse whispers reached her while she waited,
feeling as though the world had suddenly turned topsy-turvy.</p>

<p>“ ... The next turn ... can’t go on.... Let the orchestra
play.... Tell the audience she isn’t badly hurt
... turned my blood cold.... Hadn’t time to shout....
Who dropped the damned thing?... Must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
broken her spine.... Rather anyone than The Girlie
Girl.”</p>

<p>The doctor had risen from his examination and was
coming towards her. She nerved herself for a shock;
but she could hear her own heart thumping against her
ribs.</p>

<p>“Not—not——” She could not get the words out of
her dry lips.</p>

<p>The doctor gravely shook his head. “No, she’s alive.
Bad injury to the spine, I should say. Get her to a
hospital”—then taking in the quality of the woman who
had said she was the sister-in-law—“or to her home at
once and call in a specialist.”</p>

<p>Claudia read the look in his eyes, which was compounded
of pity and deep emotion. She had seen that
look once in the eyes of a man who had been entrusted
with the task of breaking the news of her husband’s
death to a poor woman on their country estate.</p>

<p>“Is she—very bad?” she whispered. “Will she die?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not—yet.”</p>

<p>Claudia reeled up against a piece of scenery. She never
forgot that moment. The orchestra playing a rag-time
melody, the stout woman sobbing, the regret in the eyes
of the doctor.</p>

<p>“You mean——”</p>

<p>“It’s not likely she will ever move off her bed again.
She’s paralysed.”</p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smaller">“OUT AT SEA”</span></h3>

<p>Such confusion as existed in Fay’s flat that night
Claudia had never conceived possibly. Life in
Circe’s household had been somewhat erratic occasionally,
but there had been a sort of order in the disorder,
and a certain peaceful current had always flowed over
internal convulsions. But in Fay’s home everything in
the way of discipline and order—if there ever were any—fell
to pieces when she was carried home unconscious.
The two domestics wailed and sobbed—Polly at first went
into hysterics, and had to have cold water thrown over
her—the telephone bell went incessantly, and almost before
Fay had been put to bed by Claudia, newspaper reporters
filled the hall with insistent inquiries.</p>

<p>Claudia, though she kept her head pretty well and
controlled the panic in her heart, had always been accustomed
to have competent underlings to do things for
her, and she did not know what ought to be done in such
a crisis, what specialist should be fetched, and where to
obtain a nurse at a minute’s notice.</p>

<p>It was Colin Paton who came to the rescue in answer
to her telephone inquiries, and reduced order out of
chaos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>Directly she saw him walk into the hall Claudia felt a
sense of instant relief. In a few minutes the reporters
had all gone, the telephone-bell rang no more, and the
specialist and nurse were on their way. No one seemed
surprised that he should take command, the servants
obeyed him without a query. He seemed to have an
almost mesmeric calming effect on everyone.</p>

<p>“Where’s your brother?” he asked, as soon as he had
a moment to spare for essentials.</p>

<p>“He’s shut himself in the dining-room.” She told
him of his attitude.</p>

<p>“It’s partly physical, just as some men—the bravest—cannot
stand the sight of blood. But I must talk to
him.... Claudia, you are dead tired. There’s nothing
more to be done at the moment. She’s still unconscious.”
The clock in the room struck eleven, and she dropped
wearily into a chair. His keen eyes suddenly took on
a tenderness that she did not see as they searched her
drawn face. “Have you had a meal this evening?”</p>

<p>She shook her head without raising her eyes, for she
suddenly felt a weak sort of feeling, so that she was
afraid if she looked up and met his gaze the tears would
come running down her cheeks. He would despise her
for such an exhibition, but everything—everything
seemed so wrong and miserable.</p>

<p>“Then you’ll have one at once.... Yes, I know you
feel as if you can’t eat, but you must.” He put his hand
on her shoulder, and there was something so sympathetic
and yet so invigorating in his touch that she felt new
courage flow into her veins. She did not know that the
sight of two tears that would escape down her cheeks
ere she could overcome her weakness nearly unnerved
him, and made the cheap tawdry little room suddenly
blur before his eyes.</p>

<p>What he said to Jack, Claudia never knew, but ten
minutes later Jack came out of the dining-room looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
like a whipped cur, but holding his head with a certain
forced rigidity, and his lips were steady as he said to
her:</p>

<p>“Claudia, is there anything I can do? I’ve been a
beast, I know. Shall I”—he could not control a wince
of repugnance—“shall I go to her?”</p>

<p>She told him that she was still unconscious. “But
when she recovers, if she asks for you, you must go to
her.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will, I will. Only, Claud, for God’s sake
don’t go away and leave us to-night. I couldn’t stand
that.”</p>

<p>Claudia looked at Paton inquiringly. Everyone seemed
to be doing that to-night. There was a slight pinkness
of her eyes, and somehow, to Paton, it gave her
a new and rather pathetic character. The dark eyes were
very heavy but curiously beautiful in the white face,
and the hard brilliancy that had characterized them recently
had temporarily vanished.</p>

<p>“I’ll stay, too, if you wish,” said Paton simply, “but in
case she recovers consciousness she might like to see a
woman she knows as well as her nurse. A woman is
always such a comfort to another in time of illness, don’t
you think?”</p>

<p>“I hardly know,” admitted Claudia, trying to force
some soup down her throat, “you see, I’ve never been
in contact with such things as—grave illnesses. Of
course I’ll stay.”</p>

<p>The specialist had arrived by this time, and Paton
left the brother and sister together. Claudia tried to
comfort him as she would have a child.</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to be heartless,” blubbered Jack, his
face working pitiably, “only you don’t know how I feel....
I do love her.... I’m sorry I was so cross about
the pendant. She put it on for <em>luck</em>.... Oh, God!”</p>

<p>It struck Claudia what a ridiculously immature couple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Fay and Jack were. They were small ships that should
have kept near shore, and now Destiny had blown them
suddenly out to sea. And she herself was tacking about
in the wind, blown this way and that, and finding no place
where she might safely anchor. Somewhere at the back
of her mind she knew Frank Hamilton was no permanent
anchorage for any woman. Surely, the children of Circe
were not the luckiest of mortals!</p>

<p>It seemed ages before Paton came back to them. Jack
was drinking himself into a fuddled state, and Claudia
was too anxious herself to keep watch over him. Afterwards
she realized that she could have written an inventory
of that commonplace room.</p>

<p>His face told them that he had no good news before
he spoke.</p>

<p>“Tell us the worst,” said Jack thickly, “always better
to know everything.”</p>

<p>“The medical verdict is paraphlegia. Fatal injury to
the nerves at the base of the spine.... She’s coming
round now. She can’t feel any pain, that’s one blessing,
poor child.”</p>

<p>“That means—she is paralysed?” whispered Claudia.</p>

<p>“From the waist downwards ... she may live for some
time. I think, Claudia, it would be kind of you to go to
her. The strange nurse might frighten her. I don’t think
we ought—to tell her there’s no hope. The doctor says it
is always better in such cases to let the patient think she
will recover. Keeps the mind from dwelling on the inevitable.
You understand, Jack?”</p>

<p>Jack nodded, and then dropping his head on his hands,
commenced to cry.</p>

<p>“My little Fay.... Never to dance again. I can’t
believe it.... Never still from morning till night....
I’m sorry I was cross about the pendant....”</p>

<p>Claudia stole softly into the garish, pretentious bedroom
that seemed to mock them all with its air of coquetry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
The nurse had reduced it to something like order, but
the thousand and one knickknacks were still lying about,
and Claudia found the pale blue satin bows odious. Two
tiny white satin slippers were on a chair. Claudia averted
her eyes from them. They would never dance gleefully
any more.</p>

<p>She found Fay lying with her blue eyes fixed wonderingly
on the nurse, who was trying to induce her to take
a restorative.</p>

<p>“Why are you here?” she was saying wonderingly.
“You’re a real nurse, aren’t you? I don’t understand.
Why am I—Oh!” She gave a cry of relief at the sight
of Claudia that accomplished the conquest of her sister-in-law’s
heart. “You’ll tell me. I like you. What’s
the matter? Oh! I do feel that tired, too tired to move!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember, dear, the curtain came down
and hit you. You—you fainted, you know. We thought
we’d get a nurse, because you—you’ll have to stop in
bed and rest for a while, and nurses know how to make
one so comfortable, don’t they?”</p>

<p>Her eyes jumped and snapped. “Ill? Me ill? Good
gracious! then I can’t play next week at Shepherd’s
Bush? I say, I must let them know at once. I’m topping
the bill, and——”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about that,” said Claudia soothingly,
“we’ll arrange that for you.”</p>

<p>Fay was silent for quite a minute, and Claudia
wondered of what she was thinking, but she did not dare
to inquire. What was going on in that unformed, unreflective
brain? Had she any suspicion?</p>

<p>“I heard of a man being struck by a curtain once,” she
said suddenly. “I must claim damages immediately. You
instruct Samuels.... The pendant didn’t bring me luck,
after all.... I ought to get heavy damages. I’ll talk to
Samuels about it to-morrow.”</p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="smaller">“ASHES”</span></h3>

<p>The following Monday morning brought an ugly
scene with Gilbert, who learned not only the tragic
and sensational news from the daily paper, but his wife’s
part in it. For somehow the reporters had found out
that she was present at the performance, and “the beautiful
Mrs. Currey” was credited in one sensational rag
with having “dashed forward heroically to try and save
her sister-in-law, The Girlie Girl, from the impact of the
curtain.” Claudia had not reckoned for this notoriety,
and if Gilbert had shown any human sympathy with poor
Fay she would have forgiven his ebullition of temper as
excusable under the circumstances.</p>

<p>“You deliberately took advantage of my being in the
country to frequent low music-halls with this woman,”
he flung at her, his eyes bloodshot with anger.</p>

<p>Claudia controlled her rising anger. “I went on the
spur of the moment, Gilbert. Jack came in to fetch me
on Saturday afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ve been planning it for some time,” he
sneered. “It was a nice thing to have to explain to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
father and mother. My mother! who has never been
in a music-hall in her life.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it would do her good if she had.... You
talk as if I knew what was going to happen.”</p>

<p>“Scandal on scandal!”</p>

<p>“Scandal! Is that all you can call it?” cried Claudia,
a picture of Fay, so pitifully flattened out under the
curtain, rising before her eyes. “Do you realize that
she is paralysed for life—that everything is <em>finished</em> for
her?”</p>

<p>“It’s a pity she wasn’t killed outright,” returned
Gilbert callously, “instead of remaining a disgrace to the
family. But my mother warned me long ago,” he added
injudiciously, almost beside himself with rage, for now
these paroxysms grew on him and contorted any sense
of fairness or kindness that had ever been in his
composition.</p>

<p>“Of what did your mother warn you?” said Claudia,
her nostrils dilating, her eyes flashing. “Of marrying
<em>me</em>? I insist on an answer.”</p>

<p>“This isn’t the first scandal in your family, is it? I’m
not throwing your mother’s sins up against you, you are
not responsible for her; but why on earth have you got
the same <em>flair</em> for the sensational? You’ve deliberately
courted this by going to see this—this woman.”</p>

<p>“Don’t call her ‘this woman,’ as though she were a
leper,” said Claudia passionately. “She’s earned her living
by hard work ever since she was fourteen years old.
How many women can boast of that? What if she
hasn’t led a conventional life? A good many women
whom you shake by the hand are a good deal less virtuous,
and certainly far less honest. Because she hasn’t dodged
behind a wedding-ring or covered up her tracks you look
upon her with contempt. And even if she were the most
unscrupulous, mercenary creature alive, you might be
sorry now. Twenty-two, and life over for her!” To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Claudia, with her Grecian appreciation of youth and life,
this seemed a tragedy of tragedies. Once, as a child,
when a gambolling puppy from the stables had got under
the wheels of the brougham and been killed she had wept
for days, and as she had looked down at the little fat
white body that would never frisk any more, she had
learned a lesson never to be forgotten. The puppy had
taught her early to see the inestimable boon of youth and
life. To be <em>alive</em>, to have all one’s faculties and powers
of enjoyment, that is the great gift of the gods, she had
told herself then. There had always been something of
the pagan in her, and she had ever refused to believe that
death is the gate of Life.</p>

<p>“So you are sprouting the modern jargon, are you?”
said Gilbert angrily. “Listen, Claudia. You married
me, and you must respect my name. I thought you were
different from the women in your set, or I should not have
married you. Apparently you are not different, but <em>I</em>
am different from the husbands of those women. You’d
better remember that. I allow you to go your own way,
I give you perfect liberty, but on condition that you do
not drag my name into club smoking-rooms and smart
restaurants. There has never been a breath of talk about
my mother, and there shall not be about my wife. If you
want that kind of notoriety—you will not remain my
wife.”</p>

<p>Claudia stood motionless, listening to this outburst, very
erect, her head thrown up, her neck making a beautiful
but disdainful line with her chin. A sarcastic, enigmatic
smile played round her sensitive mouth, and her
eyes were cold and keenly critical. She had suddenly
seen the coarseness of his lips, the deadly, soul-destroying
coldness of his self-satisfied, sombre eyes. He was merely
a male, a high-handed, aggressive male, with the highly
specialized brain of a lawyer. Heart? When had he
ever shown any heart? She had never once touched his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
heart, only his senses. His feeling for his mother and
father was only a sort of clannish family pride. Why,
even Jack’s love for Fay, lacking as it was in all the big
qualities that make love worth while, was a much finer
thing than Gilbert’s feeling for her. For a moment a
revulsion of shame, a feeling of humiliation swept over
her at the thought of what she had given him.</p>

<p>“If you were not afraid of being laughed at, of being
made to look small, you wouldn’t care a jot what I did,
would you?” she said with deadly precision. “You
have a profound contempt for women, haven’t you?
You married me for my looks, because I aroused your
passion, because it is the general habit of man to instal
a woman in his home. I am installed here and I have
the privilege of calling myself Mrs. Currey; otherwise,
had I been a woman of lower station and more easy
virtue, you would have fired me out long ago, wouldn’t
you? I am to live on the ashes of your passion—I, a
woman with no children! You are asking too much, my
husband. As for that poor, maimed child, I shall go to
her as often as she wants me.”</p>

<p>She was surprised, when he had gone, at the calmness
with which she could turn to her ordinary occupations.
She felt anger, contempt, the sting of her own humiliation,
but he had no longer the power to wound her heart.
She remembered the time—was it ages ago or only a
year or so?—when, after an altercation or lack of response
on his part, she had fled to her room and sobbed or
brooded until she had made herself ill. Then her being
had been shaken to its foundations, and she had felt the
results on her nervous system for days.</p>

<p>But this morning, once the fierce blaze of her anger
had burned out, she shrugged her shoulders and sat down
to her escritoire. She must make her life without Gilbert.
To allow a man she neither loved nor respected to
destroy her balance would be a sign of weakness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>She was organizing, with Colin Paton, a concert in aid
of a home for Penniless Gentlewomen, a charity which
had always aroused her sympathy, and there was a good
deal to be done. She was herself feeing Mrs. Milton to
sing, and she had promised to come in that morning and
give her some advice on the other artistes to be engaged.</p>

<p>It was not long before the maid showed her into her
boudoir, but a much smarter-looking woman than she had
been at Mrs. Rivington’s party. Claudia had contrived
to make her accept one or two modish dresses without
hurting her feelings or her dignity, and she had also
secured her several lucrative engagements. It is needless
to say that Margaret Milton’s generous heart held almost
an adoration for Claudia.</p>

<p>“I hope I’m not late,” she said, as she came into the
room, “but I had to do a little grave-digging before I
could get away. Ugh! I thought the whole neighbourhood
would be poisoned, the monkeys!”</p>

<p>Claudia laughingly inquired whose grave she had been
digging.</p>

<p>“You must know that a favourite cat died about a
month ago, and was gathered to—the other cats in limbo.
I allowed the children to bury it in the back garden—quite
deep—and erect a tombstone. This morning, just as I
was coming out, I became aware of an awful effluvia in
the house. I wondered if the drains had suddenly gone
wrong, and rushed round distraught. I found it was
worse at the back of the house. Then I looked out of
the window and saw——”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Yes. They had disinterred the cat to see how ‘she
was getting on.’”</p>

<p>After they had both laughed over the children’s enterprise,
they got to work. Claudia asked her opinion about
an accompanist.</p>

<p>“Lucy Hamilton used to accompany most sympathetically,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
but—no—I don’t suppose she would have
decent clothes to come up in, and I daresay she may not
have kept up her music.”</p>

<p>“Lucy Hamilton,” repeated Claudia, “not a sister
of——?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Frank’s old-maid sister. Poor Lucy! She had
such talent, and she was sacrificed to him right along.”</p>

<p>Claudia pondered a minute. “Does she still live
somewhere in the country?”</p>

<p>“Salisbury. Yes, she gives music-lessons at a shilling
an hour! It must be torture to her. Her old mother and
she live in a tiny home together.”</p>

<p>“But, Mrs. Milton,” said Claudia, bewildered, “are
they as poor as all that? How can they be when——?”
She stopped, and then she decided to put the question
that had been on her lips. “Will she not accept help
from her son Frank?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! he does help her—a little.” Then she continued
thoughtfully: “It does seem wrong, doesn’t it,
that people won’t pay for pictures nowadays. I suppose
we shall soon have no artists.”</p>

<p>Claudia stared. “But he gets big prices now for his
pictures. A couple of years ago, I know, he was nearly
starving, but he gets his own prices now.”</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Milton’s turn to look startled. For the
moment she had forgotten that Claudia and he were
friends. She tried to gloss over what might have been
an indiscretion.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear it; perhaps—no doubt he will be
able to help them more soon.... I think Miss Ronald
would accompany splendidly, and I’ve got her address
at home.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Milton,” went on Claudia, a curious expression
in her eyes, “have you heard from this Lucy Hamilton
<em>recently</em>? And has—Mrs. Hamilton been a good mother
to him—them both?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“I heard from Lucy only yesterday. I wanted her to
come up for a change—you can’t think how she revels in
a few concerts, it’s a joy to take her, and I can always
get tickets—but her own words were: ‘I’m much too
shabby to come to town; such a lot of pupils owe me
money, and mother’s illness in the winter was expensive.’”
She did not add that the writer had gone on to say that
her brother did not like her to come to town unless she
was decently dressed, and that though he was getting on
and acquiring reputation, he could not at the moment
help them more than he was doing.</p>

<p>“As for Mrs. Hamilton being a good mother,” went on
Mrs. Milton, “she’s been one of the best. Her husband
was a small solicitor and left them very badly off. It
was she who screwed the money out of the housekeeping
that Frank should go to Paris and study painting. Lucy,
who was just as clever at music, had to teach herself.
I do hope, now he is getting on, that Frank will make
their lives easier.”</p>

<p>“You don’t like him?” said Claudia abruptly. There
was a subtle something in Mrs. Milton’s tone that convinced
her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Milton hesitated.</p>

<p>“You can speak quite honestly. Why not? You knew
him for some years, did you not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we lived next door to them in the High Street
for years.... I think artists are always rather egotistical
and selfish, don’t you? His mother adored him, and
perhaps that doesn’t do a man any good. I want my boys
to have happy memories of their youth and me, but I do
try not to spoil them. I try and remember that they will
be husbands to some nice girls later on. He always let her
do all the giving ... one shouldn’t give too much, however
much one loves. One should insist on some exchange,
if only for the sake of the loved one.”</p>

<p>“And yet,” said Claudia, scrawling weird figures on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the blotting-pad, “they say that the ideal love means self-sacrifice,
that true happiness is to be found in giving.”</p>

<p>“But it isn’t an ideal world in which we live, is it?”
said Mrs. Milton gently. “Isn’t that sometimes a form of
selfishness? I know by experience with the children
that it’s often the tempting path, ‘the easiest way,’ but
if one really loves the little minds and hearts, one must
sometimes bear the tears and the sulks that follow when
you are firm. You’ll know that one day, when you have
children of your own.”</p>

<p>“And with men and women?”</p>

<p>“Many women, I think, have made themselves and
their men unhappy by giving too much and too freely. It’s
become a habit with women. We can’t stand their frowns
and their tempers. But I’m sure it’s a mistake. My
husband is the dearest of men, but at the beginning of
our life together I nearly became a doormat—just of my
own accord.... Shall we fix on Miss Ronald?”</p>

<p>They worked steadily for half an hour, when there was
a loud commotion on the stairs. It startled Margaret
Milton, but Claudia knew the cause. Pat had lately acquired
a huge puppy sheepdog, with the result that her arrival
was always somewhat like that of a circus in full swing.</p>

<p>Pat and the dog, who had been christened Socrates
because he was such a fool, came tumbling in together.</p>

<p>“He’s chewed up half a mat downstairs while I was
using your telephone, Claudia. How do you do, Mrs.
Milton. Allow me, Mrs. Milton—Socrates. Socky, go
and lie down and take a short snooze. He’s the terror of
Mayfair. He upset two children and a mail-cart this
morning, and he’s been in the Round Pond and splashed
me from head to foot. How’s poor little Fay getting
on?”</p>

<p>“No change,” said Claudia, with a sigh. “I’m going
down there after lunch.”</p>

<p>Pat drew in her breath. “Heavens! if anything like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
that should happen to me, I’d go mad! I should yell
the house down. She must know something. It’s a fortnight
now. She must suspect something.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes I wonder,” said Claudia. “Sometimes I
think I see panic in her eyes, then the next moment she’s
asking me a conundrum she’s found in some penny journal
and roaring with laughter at my wild guesses. She
talks about getting up soon—she’s had the piano taken in,
and yesterday she was singing ‘to keep her voice from
getting mildewy,’ but—I don’t know. If she knows—if
she’s got any suspicion, she’s the pluckiest little soul
I’ve ever known.”</p>

<p>After that first awful night, it had become a practice
for her to go down to the flat almost daily, each time devising
some fresh forms of amusement—Fay was like
a child—and directing the domestic machinery, which
was now much smoother. The clinging helpless hands
of Fay gave her a strange feeling, and a curious bond had
sprung up between them. To Fay, Claudia, with her
education and culture, was something wonderfully clever,
something she had never known, something that made
her long, in her generous, undisciplined heart, to emulate,
to grow into. She considered Claudia’s knowledge of
books and pictures amazing. She told all her fellow-professionals
who flocked to see her—and they were a
strange, bizarre crowd—that her sister-in-law was the
most wonderful and splendid lady in the world, and when
Jack occasionally talked carelessly of his sister, she was
roused to such volleys of wrathful words that the nurse
had to ask him not to excite her. In all her moods—sometimes
babyish, when she would play with dolls and
mechanical toys; sometimes fretful, when nothing pleased
her and she wailed to get well; sometimes optimistic and
full of ideas for new turns and songs—Claudia was always
wanted and loudly welcomed. Fay did not always
want Jack—perhaps she divined something of his repugnance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
to sickness—she did not always want her “pals,” but
she always listened eagerly for Claudia’s step in the hall,
and if she did not come, sent the nurse to the telephone.</p>

<p class="tb">Soon after, Mrs. Milton took her departure.</p>

<p>Pat sat in a low chair, her long legs sprawling half
across the room. For a long time neither of them spoke.
Claudia stood gazing out of the window across the Park.
The trees were gloriously green now, and like fluttering
heralds of summer, brilliant in the sunlight. The sun
touched the gilt of the Albert Memorial so that it mingled
with the tender greens and almost reconciled her to it.
She was thinking of Mrs. Milton’s story of Hamilton’s
mother and sister. She knew her statement was correct.
She knew several large cheques had been despatched to
him by people with whom she had brought him in touch.
Was he—she shrank from the word like a loathsome
disease—was he <em>mean</em>? He had evidently not wished
to renew his acquaintance with Mrs. Milton that night
at the Rivingtons. Why? Did he desire to forget his
small beginnings—the obligations of which she must have
reminded him? It was a corroding idea, and Claudia
was glad when Pat commenced to speak in a—for her—thoughtful
tone.</p>

<p>“I must be a throw-back. That’s the explanation always
trotted out nowadays, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“A throw-back, Pat? What on earth are you talking
about?” She turned and looked at the fresh, boyish
face, the slim, long limbs, the sophisticated and yet innocent
eyes of her sister.</p>

<p>“We’re a funny family, aren’t we? We’ve just dragged
ourselves up anyhow. I went to a lecture on heredity
the other day. What do we inherit, I asked myself?
Father’s an invertebrate jellyfish, and mother—well,
mother’s Circe! Grandfather, on mother’s side, is a gay
old dog still, and father’s father was a leader of lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
causes and died young. Bit of a jumble, isn’t it? I’ve
been puzzling over it for days. I heard someone say of
you the other day—of course, they were discussing you
in connection with The Girlie Girl—‘she’s Circe’s
daughter.’ We’re both Circe’s daughters, and I’m not a
bit like her. I say, I’m a throw-back somewhere. Mother
always cared for men, never for women. I don’t care a
scrap for men in any sexual way—oh, yes! don’t look so
wise, I’ve experimented in a few flirtations—and I simply
hate them—that way. I like hunting with them and
playing golf and wading in the water, fishing, but
directly they get sentimental and want to kiss me I curl
up inside. Most girls, I’ve found out, like being kissed,
even if they are not in love. I nearly murdered Dicky
Trevor the other day because he kissed me unexpectedly
on the nape of the neck. No, Circe hasn’t given me any
heritage, and I don’t think I’m so backboneless as father.
I’ve got a scheme growing in my head—I shan’t tell you
about it till I’m sure of my own mind—but it doesn’t
include a husband.”</p>

<p>Claudia looked attentively at her sister. For the first
time it flashed across her that the baffling thing about Pat
was that so far she was quite sexless. She had been eager
to come out for the fun of the dancing and the parties,
but she had never had that shy anticipation of love that
makes so many girls of eighteen eager to be presented.
The books she read as a child were always stirring adventure
stories, travels and records of real achievements.
Fairy-tales with the all-conquering prince had bored her,
all except the passages that dealt with sanguinary fights
and treasure-trove. Later on she had read one or two
famous French romances out of curiosity, but they had
failed to make any appeal whatever. Her enthusiasms,
her outbursts of passion, her thrills, were reserved for
golf and hockey, and she had once said that the greatest
and most satisfying moments of life to her were when she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
was on the back of her favourite horse, following the
hounds. She liked men. Indeed, on the whole, she preferred
them to women, but only because they were better
and more vigorous sportsmen and less liable to be petty
and jealous. As Claudia surveyed her she realized that
she neither could give nor did she wish to proffer advice.
Pat must face her own problem. Before her marriage
she would have rushed in where experience fears to tread,
and talked to Pat of the joys of love, of the folly of the
woman who disdained or belittled what man could offer.
Now all her landmarks were gone. She had messed up
her own life. All she could do was to listen and reflect
what an awful muddle and enigma life was for women,
and wonder why Providence had given them no chart to
steer by.</p>

<p>“You see,” continued Pat, “I’ve thought the thing out,
and it wouldn’t be playing cricket to marry a man if you
didn’t want him—that way. I tried to tell a man the
other day how I felt, and he said he’d be a chum and
wouldn’t worry me; but I saw the look in his eyes even
then, and I knew it would be hell for both of us. Men
always want women that way.”</p>

<p>Who had said something like that recently? Ah, yes!
it had been said by Jack, apropos of Colin Paton.</p>

<p>“You are very wise this morning,” said Claudia, with
a forced laugh. “If you feel this way there may be men
who also are celibates at heart.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t met any,” said Pat laconically, giving Socky
a kick to stop his stentorian dreams. “He’s chasing
bunnies in the Park.”</p>

<p>“Oh! there are men. A good many women complain
of—lack of attention on the part of their husbands.”</p>

<p>“Then the attentions go to some other woman, or he’s
an uninteresting money-grabber.”</p>

<p>“Don’t generalize so much.... What about a man like
Colin Paton?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Pat laughed derisively, so that Socky got up and
barked. “Shut up, you fool; I’m laughing at my sister,
who has the foolishness of a babe! Have you known
Paton all these years and not seen beneath the surface?
Gracious! even if he likes me—which he doesn’t expect
to crack jokes with—that would be the last man I’d experiment
with. He’s full of emotion underneath that
quiet exterior. If I could return it, I’d rather like to be
loved by Colin Paton. Why, he’d make the most tender
and ardent of lovers if he gained the heart of the right
woman. Have you seen him with his widowed mother?
Oh! he’s perfectly sweet to her, and she adores him. She’s
such a nice, cosy thing, too; you feel you want to sit on
a footstool at her feet and have her stroke your hair.”</p>

<p>“If you’re right, it’s curious he hasn’t married.”</p>

<p>She was looking out of the window again, and she
didn’t see the curious look her sister cast at her. Pat
finished up the conversation with:</p>

<p>“Come on, Socks, we’re going to our happy home. Men
like Colin Paton often get left because most women are
fools where love is concerned. It’s been the study of their
lives for centuries, and even now they can’t tell a piece of
glass from a diamond. Because a man doesn’t come along
like a raging whirlwind they think he’s cold, and because
he loudly swears fidelity like a tinkling cymbal they think
they can put their money on him. The metaphors are a
bit mixed, but what I’m driving at is this. Women seldom
have any judgment where men are concerned, and
the nicer the woman the less sound is her judgment.
Only bad women have good judgment regarding men.
I—Patricia Iverson—have spoken. Selah! Socks!”</p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="smaller">A DANGER SIGNAL</span></h3>

<p>Fritz Neeburg was busily writing in his study
when his man came to tell him that Carey Image
had called to see him. He was just starting a chapter
of his new book, entitled “Neurasthenia and its Causes,”
but he at once put his pen down.</p>

<p>“This is good of you to receive me,” said Image
warmly; “I can see you are busy.”</p>

<p>“Not too busy to stop and have a chat with you. I
hope you don’t want to consult me professionally? You
haven’t got <em>the</em> disease of the age, have you?”</p>

<p>Image shook his bird-like head and then sighed.</p>

<p>“No, but I came on behalf of someone else—someone
in whom you are interested, or I shouldn’t waste your
valuable time. Have you seen Gilbert Currey lately?”</p>

<p>“Not since the attack of influenza, when he”—dryly—“asked
my advice and didn’t take it.”</p>

<p>“Ah! you <em>must</em> see him, Neeburg.”</p>

<p>Neeburg never looked surprised or startled, he had the
Teutonic phlegmatic temperament. He waited for Image
to go on.</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, I won’t usurp your province, but I
don’t like the look of him at all. I’ve seen men before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
on the verge of a nervous breakdown. We got a good
many out in India, and I’ve come to know that curious
inward, burning look of the eyes.... I was very upset
yesterday. I met him suddenly in King’s Bench Walk
and he—didn’t know me.”</p>

<p>Neeburg opened his eyes a little.</p>

<p>“He passed it off by saying he was immersed in some
difficult case; but I could see he was intensely annoyed
with himself, and that led me to deduce it is not the first
time his memory has played a trick on him. I needn’t
say any more to you, as a physician, except that Robson,
the Attorney-General, told me in confidence the other
day that he is taking far too much work, and that he is
not—doing it well. He’s noticed a great change in him,
and he told me, as an old friend, to use my influence to
make him take a holiday.”</p>

<p>The eyes of the two men met—Image’s brilliantly
bright through his eyeglasses, those of the physician
calmly reflective. Then Neeburg got up from his seat
and paced the room without speaking.</p>

<p>“I’ve warned him repeatedly,” he said at length, “and
I’ve watched it coming. But Gilbert is not an easy man
to prescribe for. He is eaten up with ambition, he is so
keen on ‘the game’ that he takes no heed of warnings,
mine or Nature’s. That man has worked like a horse
for the last five years; in fact, he has worked incessantly
ever since his boyhood, when his father urged him to
win scholarships for the glory of the Currey family....
The father has only been half a success; he had driving
power but no judgment, and he was unpopular at the
Bar. He took up politics, but he was too vehement and
dogmatic for his party. He concentrated his ambition
on Gilbert, and Gilbert is very like him—very. With
Gilbert, what I call ‘the game’ is the very marrow of
his bones. You might as well ask him to change his
body as change his manner of life. He had a very good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
constitution, and I hoped it would stand the strain....
But it’s gone to pieces very badly of late. Outside people
will say suddenly, but he’s been undermined for some
time. If his memory is going ... God help him and
Claudia!”</p>

<p>“Extraordinary he can be so blind to her charm and
qualities ... extraordinary!... I am sometimes ashamed
he is my godson.”</p>

<p>“The men in the Currey family have—to put it bluntly—<em>used</em>
women. They have never rated them highly.
Claudia is a very emotional, highly-strung woman, with
all sorts of splendid qualities which he does not appreciate;
she was never meant to marry a Currey.”</p>

<p>“In my young days we didn’t hear so much talk of
‘the game,’ this feverish desire to work one’s self into
an early grave. Is it a modern failing, doctor?”</p>

<p>“No, men have always sacrificed themselves and devoted
their best energies to it, but to-day we are suffering
from it in an aggravated form, because most of the
things men set their hopes upon are not worth while.
It gets worse every year. This craze for luxury, for
display—and that comes a good deal from our women-folk—first
of all eggs a man on to accumulate money or
make a position, then the spirit of the game gets into
him, even if he isn’t born with it, and before he has time
to turn round and reflect he is in the midst of the scrimmage
and he doesn’t want to get out of it. It’s a poison
that eats into the very flesh, that corrodes his blood, that
makes him blind to the waste of his life. Oh! I’ve been
watching it for years.”</p>

<p>Image’s bright eyes watched Neeburg.</p>

<p>“It’s worse in America than it is here, but every day
the pace gets hotter, the gambling more feverish. The
wrecks of men that have passed through my hands, men
that at forty and earlier are practically used up, and no
amount of drugs or rest will do them much good! They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
‘get through’ the rest of their lives instead of living!
While you were in India I practised in New York for
a couple of years with Finlay McKay. One man came
to me at the beginning of my stay, and begged me to pull
him together. I preached a holiday, relaxation. He said
‘No,’ but as soon as he had made a couple of million
dollars he’d stop. He’d set himself that task. A year
later he came to me in such a frazzled state that I was
ashamed of my sex. He’d made his pile, he’d gained his
ambition. ‘Now rest,’ said I, ‘you have still a slender
chance if you’re careful.’ ‘I can’t, doctor,’ he said. ‘I
can’t do anything except work. I’ve done what I set
out to do, but I can’t stop now. Life without my work
wouldn’t be worth while. I thought it was a bank balance
I wanted, but it’s “the game!”’ I told that man I would
give him six months if he didn’t clear out of it and go
for a long sea voyage. There, in my presence, he deliberately
chose the six months. He died in four....
Most men nowadays are crazy to get ahead of other
men. To a man, ‘the game’: to a woman, love; for
whatever women may do or have done, love for them
will always remain the great adventure.”</p>

<p>“Love was for me ‘the great adventure,’ as well as for
her,” said Image quietly. “But there, I have something
of the woman in me. I realize that.”</p>

<p>“And you have a thousand happy memories, and you
still enjoy every minute of your life, don’t you? Everything
in the world interests you. You have provided
yourself with a future. You’re a wise man, Image.”</p>

<p>The little man shook his head with a smile. “A sweet
and a brave woman was wise for me, Neeburg.... You
will use your influence with Gilbert?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will try and frighten him. I did that once
very successfully, but my patient was not so stubborn as
Gilbert. He had a wife and four children, and she
begged me to stop him while there was yet time. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
already in such a state of nerves that the home was all
misery and apprehension. Generally we tell patients that
they are better than they really are, but this man I
frightened stiff. He went for a long sea-voyage, and the
fright and the cleansing breath of Nature—oh! so kindly,
if we would only heed her!—cured him. He’s doing
exceedingly well now—he’s rapidly becoming famous—but
he’s going slow, and they are bringing up their boys
to ignore this modern competitive spirit.... I’ll do my
best, Image, you may be sure of that. But his vigorous
early manhood is against him. He won’t believe, I fear,
in the danger that threatens.... Have you heard about
Colin Paton? I was told yesterday by Sir Andrew
Morgan that he’s going to create a sensation shortly by
one of the finest books on Sociology that has so far been
written. Sir Andrew read it for a publishing firm, and
he confessed it staggered him—the knowledge and judgment
of the thing. I’m glad; I always knew there was
real stuff in Paton!”</p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="smaller">AN UNEMOTIONAL FISH</span></h3>

<p>Claudia had been giving a little luncheon-party,
and she had kept Mr. Littleton, the American publisher,
in order to have a talk with him on a new volume
of poetry she had been reading. The other guests had
all gone, and she always enjoyed talking to him. It was
left to him to give her the news of Paton’s book.</p>

<p>“By and by,” he said casually, “Mr. Colin Paton is a
friend of yours, is he not? I think I have heard you
mention his name?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” returned Claudia easily, “I have known him
for years. He has always been a guide, philosopher and
friend, and especially in your department.”</p>

<p>“Don’t! It sounds as if I sold ribbons at the stores....
Then, of course, you know about this book of his on
Sociology that is bound to make a stir this autumn?”</p>

<p>Claudia sat up abruptly in her chair.</p>

<p>“What book? Has Colin Paton written a book on
Sociology?”</p>

<p>“One of the finest, if not the finest, that has yet been
written. Such a lot of twaddle and froth is usually
poured forth on that subject, but this book is the real
thing, and exceedingly well written too. I’ve secured it
for America, where we’ve got a good many books on that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
subject. But I reckon this will put all the others out of
court. Where has he got all his knowledge, Mrs.
Currey?”</p>

<p>Claudia was some little time before she replied to his
question. Colin had not told her! He had been writing
this book for a long time, and he had never confided in
her! She had thought they were such intimate friends,
she had always taken it for granted that he told her—well,
most things that were not other people’s secrets,
and she was left to learn of his book from a new friend.
Why, surely she might have expected that he would have
told her long ago of his intention to write it. She had
always thought their friendship meant that.</p>

<p>She was very hurt and also a little astounded. It was
as though a favourite and well-known view had suddenly
taken on an entirely new aspect. Another landmark that
she thought was firmly planted in almost eternal solidity
seemed to have shifted. She wondered wildly if the
whole world were not built on a quicksand, if there were
any stability or permanence in any of the human emotions
or relations. Their vaunted friendship, what was it
worth, if it did not mean that she had his confidence and
he had hers?</p>

<p>Littleton wondered at the blank look on her face as she
replied rather mechanically:</p>

<p>“Oh, I think he has been studying such questions for
years, ever since he was up at Oxford. He’s not a man
to talk much or make any show.... Yes, I can quite
imagine the book is good.”</p>

<p>She could not turn and accuse herself of living in a
fool’s paradise, for she was too unhappy to dwell in such
a favoured, sunny clime; but did she know the world she
lived in, the people by whom she was surrounded? Why,
her younger sister Pat had been accusing her only the
other day of bad judgment where men were concerned.
Pat had laughed at her on this very subject, and said she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
did not really know Colin Paton. Was it true? Can one
see a man constantly for years and not really know the
inner man? But she had always credited herself with unusual
powers of divination. She despised other people
for taking the world and its creatures at face-value.</p>

<p>“The amount of reading he must have done for this
book is enormous,” went on Littleton. “Because, unlike
most wildly enthusiastic reformers, who fling adjectives
about and scream at the top of their voices, he has
marshalled an amazing array of facts and figures. That,
and his own discrimination and judgment, make the
book so fine. And there are one or two passages, where
he lets himself go, that are absolutely stirring. As you
know”—with a laugh—“I’m in the trade, and I don’t
often enthuse over a book, but I was greatly struck with
this.”</p>

<p>“I am glad,” said Claudia dully, “very glad.”</p>

<p>This book had been in his mind for years, perhaps
ever since he left Oxford, and he had never talked of it
to her. She would never forgive him! He had not
thought her worthy of his confidence. He was not her
friend. Then a vision of him at Fay’s flat that awful
night, quietly directing everyone and watching over her,
came across her mental vision, but this only confused her
the more. Did he, like most men, look upon her as a
graceful, pretty plaything—just a woman? Was his idea
of a woman just like her husband’s, only different in
kind? Apparently she was of no real use to anyone,
except—yes, except to the little music-hall artiste whom
the family had rejected.</p>

<p>Then she looked at the man in the chair beside hers,
and as her preoccupation had made him drop his guard,
she read clearly the very personal admiration in his eyes.
For a moment they remained looking at one another, love
in the man’s eyes, a hopeless bewilderment and weariness
in Claudia’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>“Your life does not satisfy you,” said the man abruptly.
“I have known that for some time.”</p>

<p>“Is anyone satisfied with his life?”</p>

<p>She was a little startled, but a beautiful, much-sought-after
woman is seldom nonplussed by such a situation.
She had seen that look in too many men’s eyes. It was
only startling with Littleton because she had not noticed
that he was falling in love with her. Was that because
she had been thinking of Frank to the exclusion of other
men? For though love itself may not be blind, it makes
a woman insensible to the feelings of other men and her
very preoccupation often piques them into desiring her.</p>

<p>Littleton got up and leaned against the mantelpiece,
looking down upon her. His straight, spare figure, in
his unmistakable American clothing, bespoke energy and
endurance. The shape of his head, on the forehead of
which the fair hair was thinning a little, told of great
mental activity and powers of organization. Some woman
might be proud of such a man. In some ways he was not
unlike Colin Paton, save that he had the American restlessness
and nerviness, and that he lacked the fine polish
and self-possession which a man may possibly acquire,
but is usually associated with families that can count
back many centuries, and that have always tried to uphold
the best traditions of English manhood. Paton’s
ancestors had mainly been divided into two classes,
fighters and scholars. Admiral Worral Paton had fought
many a fight with Francis Drake on the high seas, and
another Paton in the reign of Elizabeth had been accounted
a great and learned savant at court. Before that
time, in the reign of Henry the Seventh, there had been
a namesake of Colin’s who had fought bravely for the
crown, and helped to subdue Lord Lovel’s rising in Yorkshire.
Claudia knew of these and of several more worthy
and later ancestors, for she had once visited his Elizabethan
country home, where his mother still lived, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
he had, with laughing comments, conducted her through
the gallery of family portraits, which showed, he said,
that there had never been any fatal beauty in the family.
But she had been struck even then, as a girl—she had
only been seventeen at the time—with the indefinable air
of breeding and intellectual distinction which they all
bore. There was an unmistakable stamp on the faces
of all the Patons, which said as plainly as words, “Death
before dishonour.” Colin had told her the story of one
youth, a gay Royalist with laughing eyes, who had fallen
from honour by parting, under pressure from the woman
he loved, with one of the King’s secrets. “But, like
Judas,” said Colin, “he went out and hanged, or rather
shot, himself almost directly afterwards. You, who feel
so intensely the joy of life—look at his laughing eyes!—will
believe that he expiated his sin.”</p>

<p>At Gilbert’s home, too, there was a small picture-gallery—not
very large, for the Curreys had never had
any artistic leanings, and had only had their portraits
painted to feed their own vanity and pomp—but the
Curreys were a different race. Worthy—yes, probably—but
heavy and coarse-featured, with none of the fineness
and delicacy that distinguished the Patons, and some of
them obviously too full-blooded, with the limited vision
which embraces only the material things of life.</p>

<p>The man who stood looking down upon her now was of
different type from either. He belonged to the virile
new world; he had its good qualities and its defects.
Like Colin, he was a good companion to be with, but he
was so virile and so mettlesome that he occasionally left
her rather exhausted.</p>

<p>“Well?” he queried smilingly, not attempting to answer
her question.</p>

<p>“I was thinking.”</p>

<p>“I know you were. One can always see the thoughts
flitting through your eyes. I have often longed to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
what you were thinking about. I believe your thoughts
are worth hearing. Won’t you tell me this time?”</p>

<p>She found herself liking his voice, which had a slight
American inflection without being nasal.</p>

<p>“I was thinking how different the American man is
from the average Englishman, both in mind, temperament
and physique.”</p>

<p>“We’re certainly beaten under the last head,” he replied,
with a frank laugh. “I am always admiring your Englishmen
from the point of view of good looks, though
you know our men can be pretty fit, as we’ve shown in
your sports’ contests. But we’re not such good lookers,
sure. As for temperament”—he looked at her with a
little challenge in his grey-blue eyes—“that isn’t racial,
you know; it’s individual. I guess one of my countrymen
may possess it as well as an Englishman. And what
do you mean by a temperament, anyway?”</p>

<p>Claudia shook her head. She refused to be drawn.
“Impossible to define. Those who have it do not need
a definition, and those who have it not—will never find
one. Didn’t someone once say: ‘Art is life seen through
a temperament’?”</p>

<p>“But I’m not an artist,” he replied quickly, “only a
merchant, who purveys works of art through the medium
of a printing-press. Do you think that only professed
artists may possess a temperament?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. That would be too ridiculous. I
daresay some of the greatest artists are inarticulate.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear you say that, because I should have
hated to have you put me right out of court. Because,”
he spoke slowly, “lately I have begun to realize that a
certain resurrection is going on within me; that what I
tried deliberately to kill is still alive, painfully alive.”</p>

<p>She was aware that he was on the verge of a confidence,
and she only looked her interest. She liked him,
and she felt she wanted to know more about him; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
never had they discussed their private lives with one another.
He was introducing a new element into their
friendship.</p>

<p>“I married before I was twenty-two, and last fall I
became a widower. I married early after deliberation
and sober reflection. Isn’t it curious that one can so
often reflect more soberly when one is twenty than when
one is approaching forty, as I am now? I married, my
friends said, most suitably. I was not what you would
call in love with her. I had known her for years, and
I was fond of her in a quiet, unemotional way, which
you people of temperament despise. I married young
to have my mind and energies free for my work of restoring
an old firm to its original activity and greatness. I
realized that if youth wants to toe the straight line, it
must keep clear of emotional complications. I saw other
men taken off their work, their senses flaying them into
madness and folly, by the women they met. I determined
that I would marry and keep clear of attractive women.
I would settle down early into a family man, and if there
were joys that I knew not—well, the man who has been
born blind doesn’t know the glory of the sunshine. My
wife was placid and quite content with the small amount
of leisure and attention I could give her. All my best
energies I gave to my work. Every American is born ambitious;
it’s in the very air he breathes, and with his
first little squalling breath he draws it in. I had rather
a tough fight, but I won out all right.... Now I am
nearly forty I begin to wonder if I have done the best
with my life; I begin to see that perhaps those other
fellows who never got on are not to be pitied after all.
I begin to feel a hiatus in my life; I begin to see what
life <em>might</em> be.”</p>

<p>As he looked at the beautiful vivid woman among the
cushions of the armchair, he recalled the quiet, orderly
life he had led with the one who had borne his name,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the lack of anything approaching exaltation or beauty in
their relationship, the prosaic monotony of their days,
and he wondered if he had not been the greatest of God’s
fools. What would life be with such a woman as the
one Who now sat plaiting her fingers in her lap, her very
finger-tips pulsating with life? The magnetism of her
womanhood reached him as he stood, and made his
breath come more quickly. They had so much in common
already, was it too wild and venturesome to hope that
they might have more?</p>

<p>“In short,” she said slowly, “you have sacrificed the
best years of your life to what you men call ‘the game.’
But you have succeeded. Many men sacrifice everything
and—fail. You may feel at odd moments that you have
missed something, but I expect you are really quite satisfied.
You know the proverb about the cake?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but did I choose the best kind of cake?”</p>

<p>She broke the spell by laughing. It sounded so odd.
It reminded her of the days when, as a child, she used
to hover over the plate of cakes anxiously seeking to
make a good choice.</p>

<p>“That’s life,” she laughed. “If you take the chocolate
one, you always wish you had taken the jam-puff.
And, after all,” a little wearily, “what does it matter—chocolate
or jam? Equally sweet, perhaps, and equally
unwholesome.”</p>

<p>He joined in her laugh and held out his hand. “I must
go now. Let me come again soon, will you? I enjoyed
your charming luncheon-party, but much more have I
enjoyed this talk with you. Somehow I always want
to talk to you, and I have the reputation for being rather
a silent man. I wonder why you inspire me?”</p>

<p>Her hand was in his and she smiled mischievously and
mockingly as she said: “I suppose it’s because I talk so
much. It makes you feel that you must uphold the superior
ability of your sex in all things, even conversation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>But he did not smile. His eyes were searching her
face, noting the soft, velvety texture of the skin—how he
longed to press his lips on her full, creamy throat even
more than on her lips—the satiny gloss of her luxurious
hair, the long eyelashes which, as he stood above her,
swept her cheeks, the small, straight nose and delicate
ears.</p>

<p>“You are a very sweet and fascinating woman,” he
said suddenly, “and I am sorry that we ever did anything
so vulgar as to use your portrait for a book cover....
Good-bye.”</p>

<p>For a few minutes after he had taken his departure
Claudia sat thinking about him. Unlike Frank Hamilton,
he did not set her pulses singing, and leave her inwardly
shaken when he released her hand; but, on the other
hand, she found herself considering him more seriously.
She conjectured more about him; she found herself
wanting his opinion, just as she did Colin Paton’s. Colin!
That reminded her of the beginning of their conversation.
Colin had clearly shown that their friendship was
to him but a small thing. She found herself clenching
her fingers into the palm of her hand as she reflected
on the secret he had kept from her. This man Littleton
was not in any way the equal of Colin Paton, either in
brain or in character; but he was evidently trying to tell
her how much he appreciated their acquaintanceship,
trying to let her know that he realized now what a big
part a woman might play in his life. Pat was quite,
<em>quite</em> wrong. Colin was an unemotional fish; he even
took their friendship coldly.</p>

<p>“And I want love, life, warmth!” she cried to her
empty drawing-room. “I am tired of leading this deadly
existence. I want someone to love me, to tell me so, to
make me feel that he loves me.”</p>

<p>She looked at the room through a blinding mist, so that
the delicate walls and the Louis Quinze furniture all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
swum in a haze, and nothing stood out save the fact that
the room, like her heart, was empty, and there was no
one to hold out two arms ready to enfold her.</p>

<p>Then she strangled a sob in her throat, and the room
became once more the charming, orderly room it always
was, filled with sweet scented flowers and majestic palms.</p>

<p>“You’re a fool, Claudia, a fool! a fool! a fool!” she
said through her half-closed teeth. “You want things
that you will never get, that probably don’t exist except
in your stupid imagination.”</p>

<p>Then she went quickly out of the room to her bedroom,
where her outdoor clothes were lying on the bed. She
rang the bell for her maid.</p>

<p>“Order the car for me, please. I am going to see Mrs.
Iverson. Give me that box of picture-puzzles I got for
her.”</p>

<p>Fay always wanted her. She would go where she was
wanted.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="smaller">WHY NOT?</span></h3>

<p>Claudia asked the usual question of the nurse
who met her in the hall of the flat. It was now
three weeks since Fay’s accident.</p>

<p>“Sir Richard said definitely to-day that everything has
now been tried,” said the nurse sadly, for both the day
and the night nurse had grown fond of their odd little
patient. “I think they always knew it was hopeless....
I fear she is growing suspicious. She cried a good deal
of last night, and only slept for a couple of hours. Nurse
Calderon said she thought she heard her whisper to herself
in the night: ‘Oh, God! I can’t! I can’t! Let me
get better!’ Poor little thing! It’s too horrible, and,
of course, everything will—will get worse.”</p>

<p>Claudia, who had read up the progress of such cases in
a medical book she had found in Gilbert’s library, gave
assent. She knew that the end of such cases is the
abject humiliation of human flesh where so many of the
functions of the body are paralysed. The account had
made her feel sick in the reading, and she shrank from
the thought of all that lay before the girl—she was little
more—who lay in the bedroom beyond.</p>

<p>Claudia opened the bedroom door full of misgivings,
her heart very heavy as the thought of Fay’s night vigil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
so that she was unprepared for the sight that met her
gaze. The room always was a bower of flowers, generally
coloured ones, for Fay said bluntly that white ones reminded
her of a funeral; but this afternoon it presented
an unusually gay aspect. The apartment was almost
gaudy, and at first Claudia did not take in why it was so
bright. Fay was propped up among a nest of pillows,
her tiny face, very little changed, hidden under an
enormous black hat with three great blue feathers floating
over it. The bed was strewn with hats, the chairs
were littered with them. Pink cardboard boxes of various
sizes stood everywhere.</p>

<p>“Darling, you’ve come in the nick of time,” called out
Fay excitedly. “Isn’t this a duck of a hat? You see, I
must have some new hats. I shall be better soon now,
and it’s no good getting up and finding you’ve got nothing
to put on your cocoanut. And Madame Rose has got all
her new models for the summer. This is French. You
can see that with half an eye, can’t you? I call it shick,
don’t you? Something like a hat.”</p>

<p>A dark-eyed Jewess, who had evidently brought the
hats, was standing at the foot of the bed, and broke in
with:</p>

<p>“Straight from Parry, Miss Morris,” she said glibly,
though it was evident that it had been concocted in
some cheap London warehouse. “Very latest thing.
Real style there. I thought of you as soon as I saw it.
It’s too good for anyone else, I said.”</p>

<p>“Ah! did you? Give me the hand-glass. I want
to see how my dial looks under it. Ugh! like an under-done
muffin left out in the rain. Give us over the rouge
and the powder-puff. And the bunch of curls out of the
drawer. Where’s that eyebrow pencil I had this morning?
I rub the blessed stuff off on the pillow. There!
that’s better, cocky. Now I’ve got a bit of bloom. We’re
not forty and in the cupboard yet, thank the Lord! It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
saves a lot of trouble if you’ve got dark eyebrows. Yours
don’t rub off and get smeary, do they?”</p>

<p>“It’s curious,” smiled Claudia, removing one of the
hats in order to sit down, “that your eyebrows are so
light when your hair is so dark.”</p>

<p>Fay gave a whoop that showed her lungs were not
affected.</p>

<p>“You dear holy innocent! Did you think my hair was
really this colour? Not much. The hair-dresser does
it, and jolly expensive it is. My hair, as a child, was a
silly soppy sort of light shade, so I improved on it. I’m
much more effective with black hair. Makes a bit of a
contrast. Got the idea out of a story where a man was
raving over blue eyes and black hair. First of all, I tried
red. But it’s so difficult with hats and all the boys call
you Ginger.”</p>

<p>She might have been discussing the colour of a parasol,
so impersonal and frank was her tone. Evidently it never
occurred to her that these were what is called in ladies’
papers, “secrets of the toilet-table.”</p>

<p>Fay turned to the girl, who was adjusting the trimming
on another hat, equally large and covered with
roses of a nightmare shade of pink.</p>

<p>“You remember my hair when it was red, don’t you,
Vera?” She chuckled. “I remember you didn’t know
me when I came into the shop, and you was so polite”—she
gave Claudia a wink—“that I knew you hadn’t
spotted me. I’d run up the devil of a bill, and Madame
Rose was giving me the frozen eye just then. I think
I shall keep to black now. It does suit me, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Admirably,” returned her sister-in-law, controlling a
desire to laugh.</p>

<p>“I like your hair,” commented Fay; “there are sort of
coloury bits in it. I thought at first you must dye it, only
Jack told me you didn’t, and that it was like that when
you were a kid. It’s real pretty. Darling, try on this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
hat. I want to see it on someone else. There’s no doubt
it’s stylish. I hate the sort of hats nobody notices. When
I pay big money I like to get the goods.”</p>

<p>Claudia good-naturedly removed her own smart
little toque of white brocade and skunk, and placed the
top-heavy <em>confection</em> upon her head.</p>

<p>Fay’s face was a study in astonishment and dismay as
she looked at the other woman.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m blowed! It looks—oh! sort of funny—and”—she
shook her head—“Vera, are you sure it’s good
style? All right, keep your hair on, I didn’t say it wasn’t,
only—— Crickey Bill, does it look like that on me?”</p>

<p>The girl from the shop eyed Claudia with no great
favour. Her small, beady eyes looked sourly and enviously
at the perfectly-cut, black velvet gown and elegant
skunk and ermine furs. She was cute enough to
realize that Claudia’s clothes were the “real thing” and
spelt not only money—her own wares were absurdly
overpriced—but taste. She was accustomed to serving
“ladies” in the profession, who familiarly called her
“Vera, my dear,” and asked, and generally took her advice,
as well as swallowed her fulsome flattery.</p>

<p>“Take it off,” said Fay almost sharply. “I hate it
now. It’s too large, it’s too——” Then, with a sudden
change to wistfulness, she added, “but it’s you that
makes it wrong. You’re good style, and I’m not. I’m
common, dead common. I don’t wonder you didn’t want
me in the family.”</p>

<p>“Fay, dear, don’t.” Claudia glanced at the sulky Vera,
who was packing up the hats. Apparently Fay had
never heard of the undesirability of washing dirty linen
in public.</p>

<p>“You’re a lady. A blind man could see that. If you
hadn’t been so sweet I’d have hated you directly I saw
you. I knew what you were at once. Of course, Jack
is a perfect gentleman, but that’s different somehow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
except”—vaguely—“I liked him a bit extra for it. He
looks different in his clothes to the other men, and yet
those men spend a lot of money too. I knew a man
once, he owned a couple of halls in the Midlands, and he
told me he had fifty-two waistcoats, one for every week
of the year. I don’t suppose Jack’s got as many as that?”</p>

<p>She was adjusting a saucy matinée cap, a dainty affair
of pink ribbon and lace.</p>

<p>“I am sure he hasn’t.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you take no hat at all?” said the annoyed
shop-girl, breaking in rudely. “You might take this one
with the pink roses. I’m sure that’s quite enough.”</p>

<p>“No, no, I’ll wait till I can come to the shop. Here,
my dear, here’s a half a crown for your trouble. I’ll come
in—soon.” She looked quickly from the shop-girl to
Claudia, a desperate question in her blue eyes.</p>

<p>“That’s a much better arrangement,” returned Claudia
cheerfully. “We’ll go together, shall we?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” cried Fay eagerly, clapping her hands.
“But, I say,” as the door closed behind the girl and her
hat-boxes, “will you take me to <em>your</em> hat shop where that
came from?”</p>

<p>“With pleasure.”</p>

<p>“What; come here.” Fay beckoned her imperiously
to her side. “Do you mean you are not ashamed of
me? I could keep my mouth dead shut, you know. Do
you mean that you’d let me wear the same sort of hats
as you, that you’ll try and make a lady of me?”</p>

<p>Claudia could not speak, she gently nodded.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Fay huskily, her eyes suspiciously moist,
“you’re <em>it</em> all right, that’s all I can say. I—you can touch
me for anything you want. You’ve only got to ask me.
I say, hand me over that leather case from the chest of
drawers—yes, that’s the one.”</p>

<p>Wonderingly, Claudia obeyed, and handed her the
case which was a cheap leather imitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>Fay opened the case with a key from under her pillow
and rummaged inside. Presently she produced a small
box.</p>

<p>“There! I want to show you this. It’s for you. It’s
quite straight; you needn’t think I got it in any—any
way you wouldn’t like. I bought it off someone who was
hard up.” “It” was a diamond and ruby brooch, and
quite a tasteful affair in the form of two hearts, transfixed
by an arrow.</p>

<p>“Oh! but Fay, I couldn’t——”</p>

<p>“Take it, I say, or I shall think you don’t mean what
you said just now. Two hearts, d’yer see—you and
me! Quite romantic, isn’t it? Put it on that lacy thing
at your throat. Yes, it looks nice. No, you’re not going
to thank me. Just give me a kiss, that’s all.”</p>

<p>For a few moments the lips of the two met, so different
in their upbringing and views of life, but strangely
brought together by the hand of Fate.</p>

<p>“Now look at my joolery. Never seen it, have you?
Well, it aint so dusty, if I says it. I’ve always got them
to shell out all right. After all,” with a quaint little
touch of vanity, “when you top the bill you’re worth
it, and I don’t believe in making yourself cheap or making
men meaner than they are. Not that I exactly like
them for what they give you, but it shows they do like
you, because a man doesn’t stump up easily.... There,
that’s a stunning pendant, isn’t it? It cost two hundred
and fifty, because I went and chose it.”</p>

<p>Claudia was astounded at the value of the jewellery
that reposed in the shabby, unremarkable leather case.
She saw that Fay loved the things by the way she touched
them. Some of them were beautiful. But presently Fay
gave a sigh and, selecting a large diamond pendant which
she put round her neck, over her nightdress, she shut up
the case. “Put the things back,” she said queerly. “I—I——”
Then, to Claudia’s dismay, she began to sob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
rather pitifully like a frightened child. Claudia drew the
little head to her breast.</p>

<p>“Hush, dear, you mustn’t excite yourself. It’s bad
for you. Nurse will say it’s my fault, you know.”</p>

<p>“I’m not very old,” sobbed Fay, “I’m only twenty-two.
Some people live to be very old.”</p>

<p>Claudia tried to think of a laughing reply, but no words
would come. She could only rearrange the matinée cap
and put her own cool cheek against the one wet with
tears.</p>

<p>“Fay, dear, to please me—you said you’d do anything
for me—don’t cry so. Are you—are you in pain?”</p>

<p>She wiped the tears away gently with her handkerchief,
the rouge from the cheeks coming off too.</p>

<p>Presently Fay grew a little calmer.</p>

<p>“Claudia, I want to ask you something because you are
honest.” Oh! how Claudia’s heart sank! She dreaded
what the next words would be, but as usual the unexpected
came from Fay.</p>

<p>“Do you think <em>this</em> is a punishment for—for not being
good? Nurse has got a Bible, and I—just for fun—asked
her to read me a bit. It frightened me. I’m not
what you call bad, am I?”</p>

<p>“No, Fay,” said Claudia steadily, determined that not
all the religion or moral teaching in the world should
make her distress the doomed woman. “No, Fay, don’t
distress yourself. I don’t believe for an instant this is a
punishment.” She tried to speak simply, but the task
was difficult. Her own religion was a very vague one. She
believed that if there were a God, as so many Christians
averred, a God who was all-loving, understanding beyond
finite conception, there could never be any question of
punishment such as Fay suggested. Fay’s mind and
morals were stunted, undeveloped. Since she had come
in contact with the queer people who were her fellow
“pros,” Claudia had come very clearly to recognize that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the lives of such artistes, especially those like Fay, who
had been born practically on the boards of a music-hall,
were not subject to the ordinary judgments of society.
Theirs was a little world of its own, with its obligations,
its own ideas of right and wrong. To do another
artiste out of a job, to queer her turn, to refuse to put
your hand in your pocket for a deserving case, to crib
another person’s business or her “fancy boy,” those were
unpardonable sins in Fay’s world. To have flitted from
lover to lover—in her case without any breaking of hearts
or ugly recriminations—was only a venial one.</p>

<p>Fay gave a huge relieved sigh. “If you say so, I
won’t worry about that any more. Of course, mind you,
I ought to have kept straight. Mother told me that when
I was a kid. But I don’t know. Men always liked me,
you see, and I’m fond of them. Of course, I know <em>you</em>
wouldn’t do the things I’ve done.”</p>

<p>Claudia inwardly winced. That very morning she had
had an impassioned lover-like letter from Frank complaining
that she never came for the sittings now. “I
know you have been a great deal with your sister-in-law,
but sometimes I fear you cannot care for me when you
can live without seeing me. To me, you are the whole
world.”</p>

<p>“I expect Jack and I are pretty poor tripe,” continued
Fay calmly. Then a new thought struck her. “I say,
that night I fainted, I thought I heard a nice voice in the
hall, a man’s voice. It wasn’t the doctor, because he’s got
a down-in-your-boots voice, and it wasn’t none of my
pals. Was it someone, or did I fancy it?”</p>

<p>“I think it was probably a friend of mine, Colin Paton.
He got the specialist and nurse for you, and often inquires
after you.”</p>

<p>“That’s jolly decent of him, because he doesn’t know
me from Adam.” She looked round her at the many
vases crowded with flowers. “But people have been nice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
to me, haven’t they? It shows I’m liked, doesn’t it?”
It was such harmless vanity that Claudia smiled. “Is
your friend a great swell, Sir Somebody or other?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, no.” Claudia found herself laughing at
the idea of anyone calling Colin Paton “a great swell.”
She must remember to tell him, he would enjoy the joke
too. Then she stiffened a little. No, she would not
tell him <em>anything</em>. He left her out of his life. “He’s
the simplest and kindest of men, a friend one can always
rely on.” Her sense of fairness prompted her to say so
much.</p>

<p>“He’s old, then?”</p>

<p>“No, about thirty-eight. Did my description sound like
a greybeard?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ‘kind’ sounds so old somehow. Of course, he’s
gone on you. He must be. Would he come and see me,
do you think? Why,” with a sudden flash of inspiration,
“it must be the man Polly said was here that night and
treated her as if she was a duchess, and thanked her for
everything. Polly flopped immediate. She’s had a
balmy look ever since. Oh, yes, I don’t think! Is he
handsome?”</p>

<p>“No, only nice looking.”</p>

<p>“Well, I should like him to have black, flashing eyes—don’t
you love black, flashing eyes—and dark curly
hair, and long, white hands like the man in the novel,
‘Did He Love Her.’ I’ll just have to listen to his voice....
Must you go now? Oh, well, I suppose I mustn’t
be selfish. Jack will be in soon. It’s rough on Jack
me being like this, isn’t it? Only a log for a wife....
He’s better than I expected, because”—with a canny wag
of her head—“Jack didn’t marry me to have me lying
here, like this. Men like their women to be pretty lively
and ‘on the go,’ especially when they marry someone of
my sort. Poor old boy! I’m really fond of Jack, you
know. He’s always treated me decently. I hope I’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
get well or else—— All right, yes, of course, I won’t
worry. Come again to-morrow. Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“To my mother’s. She’s got a musical afternoon, and
I must look in. Several grand opera stars and a great
pianist. It will be very fireworky, I’m sure. Good-bye,
dear.”</p>

<p>Fay kissed her hand gaily as Claudia smilingly withdrew.</p>

<p>In the hall she met Jack coming in.</p>

<p>“Hallo! Claud.” He heaved a deep sigh. “I say, this
is breaking my heart.”</p>

<p>“Don’t think about <em>your</em> heart, think about hers,” said
Claudia, putting her hand on his shoulder. He looked
very dejected and some of the youth had gone out of
his face. The contented, well-fed expression was flecked
with something closely resembling unhappiness. “She
is not likely to live for many years, and let’s try and make
the best of it for her, Jacky boy.”</p>

<p>“It’s hell hearing her talk about her new songs and
going to Paris with me.... I shall blurt out the truth
one day, sure as Fate. It’s lucky I’ve got a stolid sort of
look, but it breaks me up inside. I remember talking
to you once about thinking too much and rootling about
for meanings in life. Why should Fay have to die like
this? She hasn’t harmed anyone!”</p>

<p>Claudia shook her head and was silent. Many greater
minds than poor Jack’s had wrestled with that problem,
and there had never been, and never would be, any answer.
With Jack, his belated questioning was rather pathetic.
He had never wanted to ask questions, he had been content
just to live, and now his happy-go-lucky love for
Fay had turned into tragedy.</p>

<p>As they stood there they could faintly hear the parrot
in the distance still calling, “Chuck it! Chuck it!” accompanied
by a hoarse chuckle that seemed to mock them
with some uncanny knowledge. The little hall was tidy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
now, but it meant that its volatile mistress would never
dash through it any more.</p>

<p>“I say, Claud,” said Jack, taking off his coat, “what’s
come over Gilbert? I went into court to-day—a fellow I
know was interested in an arbitration case, had money invested—and
when we got there I found Gilbert had been
briefed. He started splendidly in that ‘listen to me’ sort
of manner, and then he got muddled. He couldn’t remember
the name of the firm he was speaking about, and
he had to ask his junior. Everybody was noticing it.
Why, he used to have such a ripping memory! What’s
wrong with the works?”</p>

<p>Claudia was not so alarmed as she well might have
been had she known the symptoms of nerve breakdown.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he took the case up in a hurry, sometimes
he has to do that, you know.”</p>

<p>“No, he didn’t, because the fellow with me told me
that he knew he had been secured for the case a long
time ago. I heard someone say he was going to pieces.”</p>

<p>“He wants a holiday.... Mother will think I am
never coming. Go in and talk to Fay.”</p>

<p>He saw her into her car, and a few minutes later
Claudia found herself alighting on the red carpet outside
her old home. The sounds of a violin played by a master
hand reached her as she entered. The Rivingtons
were just going, Mrs. Rivington very shrill and chatty,
and the General rather tottery and deaf.</p>

<p>“I say,” said Mrs. Rivington, with a glint of malice in
her eye, “is it true your friend Frank Hamilton is going
to marry Mrs. Jacobs? Good thing for him, I should
say. She’s just rolling in money, almost indecent, and
anyone can see she’s madly in love with him. It’s all
very well to talk art,” sneeringly, “but it usually spells
money, doesn’t it? Artists are just like the rest of us,
only they pretend a bit more. He’s always with her, so
I suppose the engagement will be announced soon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>Claudia attributed the remarks to ill-nature on Mrs.
Rivington’s part, for her chief occupation in life was
planting arrows as often as she could in the weak spots
in her friends’ armour. Claudia could afford to smile
serenely in reply. Did she not know whom Frank loved?
A woman rather enjoys a clandestine love-affair, and
Claudia hugged to herself her closer knowledge of Frank’s
inner life. She knew she was the core of it.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hamilton’s in there now, talking to the Duchess
of Roxford,” continued Mrs. Rivington. “Ridiculous
how artists are run after, isn’t it? I don’t suppose he
was anyone in particular. Artists never are. Some people
find that interesting, but I must say, personally, I prefer
good breeding. So unmistakable. Good-bye. It’s too
dreadful about The Girlie Girl, but I was right, after all,
wasn’t I?”</p>

<p>Claudia stood quietly in the doorway until the violinist,
the great Ysaye, had finished playing. There were many
well-known people present, great names in the social and
artistic firmaments, for Circe had always held a little
court all her life, and she had cleverly managed to pursue
her uneven way without offending any of the powerful
social leaders, who, though they always remembered her
trespasses against her, generously spoke with more or less
indulgence of them. She was hated by a few, like Lady
Currey, but they did not count for very much. Circe had
never been actively malicious, and she had always been too
immersed in her own affairs to find time to be inquisitive
about other people’s, hence she had acquired a certain
reputation for fair dealing and generosity of character
not altogether deserved. Now she very seldom entertained,
but when she did so, she did it superlatively well,
and many artists she had encouraged in their young and
aspiring days were glad to do her honour.</p>

<p>The music stopped and she found Frank at her side.</p>

<p>“At last! I have been waiting for you all the afternoon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
I was afraid you were not coming. Claudia, this cannot
go on. You are driving me mad. It is deliberate? Have
you all the time just been playing with me?”</p>

<p>“Hush! don’t be so indiscreet.” She smiled, for Mrs.
Rivington’s words returned to her mind. Frank Hamilton
attracted by Mrs. Jacob’s money-bags! “I’ll talk to
you later. You shall get me some tea. I must go over
and speak to mother.”</p>

<p>She threaded her way, with handshakes and smiles, to
where Circe, in a most exquisite frock, sat in a shaded
corner, among a lot of scented cushions. She was talking
with more animation than usual to a man whose back was
towards Claudia. With her quick eye for beauty, she
noticed that he had a particularly well-shaped head,
which was finely set on his shoulders. Circe was talking
in French to him.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Eh bien, mon cher, Claudia est très belle, et elle est—</i>”</p>

<p>Circe caught sight of her, and stopped short. Had it
not been almost impossible, Claudia would have thought
that her mother looked distinctly embarrassed and taken
aback. Then the well-known sweet smile drifted over
her still beautiful mouth, and the momentary impression
vanished.</p>

<p>“Claudia, we were just talking of you. You are late,
child. Let me introduce to you an old friend, Mr.
Mavrocopoulos.”</p>

<p>The man rose and bowed with unusual grace, and
Claudia saw a very well-preserved man of about fifty-five,
with black hair flecked with grey, and remarkably
fine dark eyes. She returned his evident look of interest,
and again she received a peculiar impression as of something
that was vaguely familiar and yet somewhat
dreamlike. She was aware that Circe was watching
them.</p>

<p>“Have I not met you before?” inquired Claudia. “Your
face seems familiar to me, somehow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>Something flashed into his eyes, and his lips smiled as
he turned to Circe.</p>

<p>“No, Claudia, I don’t think you can remember Mr.
Mavrocopoulos. He has not been in England for many
years.”</p>

<p>“But I saw you when you were a child of three,” said
the man. “I remember you well, very well. I do not
pretend that I should have known you as that child, but
I remember you well.”</p>

<p>Claudia knew his name as that of a famous and very
wealthy Greek family, and she recalled a rumour that had
once linked it with her mother’s. Had they found happiness
together? Were there golden memories between
them? She wondered curiously how a man and woman
felt in such a case, who, after the lapse of many years,
met again. Did yesterday seem as to-day? Was memory
sharp or dulled by time, did they remember the high-water-mark
of their passion, or the moment when they
had said good-bye? Were they glad to meet again? If
she and Frank met after many years, would they——?
Then suddenly she heard Fay’s voice saying confidently:
“I know you wouldn’t do the things I’ve done.” But
Circe had done them, too, and she had not had the excuse
poor Fay could bring forward.</p>

<p>There were no signs of regret on her mother’s face.
She never spoke as one who finds any bitterness in the
dregs of such a past. Indeed, she always spoke as one
who felt that she had fulfilled her destiny, who has eaten
stolen fruit joyously, without a scruple, without a fear.
Her mother’s contempt was for women who looked longingly
over the hedge and were afraid to jump.</p>

<p>With a few more words Claudia left the two
together.</p>

<p>Circe’s slanting eyes, carefully made up, but in the
shaded light still siren-like and magnetic, looked for some
seconds into the eyes of the man beside her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>“She is like you, Demetrius, and she has always been
my favourite,” she murmured.</p>

<p>His only answer was to take her hand in his, and raise
it to his lips.</p>

<p>“I return to Rome next week, but I take back with me
a living picture, the incarnation of a dream.”</p>

<p>Claudia was sipping the cup of tea that Frank had
procured for her, when she bethought herself that she
had not yet seen Patricia.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Pat? It is not humanly possible that
she has tucked herself in a corner!”</p>

<p>His eyes were hungrily devouring her face, and lingering
on her lips, so that she had the pleasant sensation of a
secret caress. Mrs. Jacobs! How ridiculous!</p>

<p>“I saw her disappear half an hour ago in a conspirator-like
manner with Mr. Colin Paton, into that room over
there.”</p>

<p>He pointed to a closed door, which was the door of the
library.</p>

<p>“Nonsense. What have they got to conspire about?”</p>

<p>There was a little frown between her brows. Colin
was <em>her</em> friend.</p>

<p>“Why do men and women usually conspire to be alone
together?”</p>

<p>Without answering, Claudia crossed the hall, and
abruptly turned the handle of the library-door.</p>

<p>Seated close together, talking very earnestly, Pat more
excited than she had ever seen her, were the two whom
Frank had seen disappear half an hour before. As a
matter of fact, it had only been ten minutes, but Frank
had always had his doubts of Colin’s friendship.</p>

<p>“ ... bushels of apples and immense quantities of ...”
Pat was saying, when her sister came in. “Oh! Claudia,
you have come. We’d almost given you up.”</p>

<p>In an utterly different style from her own, Patricia
was looking most attractive that afternoon. She had on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
soft white charmeuse gown, which showed the long lines
of her figure, and clung around her in a manner calculated
to send her admirers crazy. The cool nonchalant
look which she usually wore had given place to something
more intense, more human. Something seemed to have
aroused her from her virginal slumber, and is not that
brightness in the eyes, that flush on the cheek, generally
aroused by a male? Claudia took all this in at a glance,
and it was not till afterwards that she had time to
reflect on the odd subject-matter of their earnest conversation.</p>

<p>“I wondered where you were,” said Claudia, rather
frigidly. “How do you do, Colin? I think mother wants
you, Pat.” It was a fib, but she had to explain her
entrance.</p>

<p>Then she turned with a sweet but cold smile to Colin
Paton, who had quietly risen.</p>

<p>“I hear you have written a great book and are going to
become famous. Congratulations! I must buy a copy
as soon as it comes out.... Frank, I want some more
tea. I’m so thirsty.”</p>

<p>Pachmann was playing as they made their way back to
the tea-room, his fairy-like fingers lightly caressing the
keys into exquisite joyousness.</p>

<p>“I want you to come to the studio to dinner next
Monday,” said Frank eagerly. “You always said you’d
like to meet Henry Bridgeman and his wife if I could
arrange it?” Claudia was a great admirer of Bridgeman’s
etchings. “Well, they are coming to dinner at the
studio on Monday. Will you come too?”</p>

<p>“Of course, I shall be delighted,” returned Claudia,
not even troubling to think of her engagements. “I shall
love it. And”—with a hard laugh—“I’ll come for a
sitting to-morrow if you like, before I go to Fay....
Dear, you mustn’t say such things here. It’s compromising.”
A loud chord on the piano, immediately followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
by the sound of a man’s voice, made her raise a
warning finger. “Hush!”</p>

<p>The words came clearly enough to both of them as they
stood together.</p>

</div>

<p>After all, why had she so many scruples? How did
she come to be possessed of them? Why did she hesitate
to grasp her happiness?</p>

<p>She looked up and found Colin Paton’s eyes fixed upon
her, and they wore an expression she did not know.</p>

<p>Then she heard Frank’s voice murmuring in her ear.
“Claudia, if you only knew how much I love you. If
you would only trust yourself to me. Why are you
afraid?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she said truthfully, “I don’t know.”</p>

<p>She gave him a particularly tender smile, out of sheer
feminine perverseness, impelled by something that rankled
and festered within her. Colin Paton should be made to
understand that there was at least one man who was a
real friend to her, yes, and might be more.</p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="smaller">NATURE’S FAULT</span></h3>

<p>Claudia was leisurely dressing for the dinner
<i lang="fr">à quatre</i> at Frank’s studio, leisurely, because there
was something in the warm May air, stealing in through
the windows, that made her dawdle and dream. She
and Pat had motored out into the country that morning,
and lunched at a quaint old inn covered with wistaria,
just outside Penshurst, and the spell of the country, with
its riot of scent and song, still possessed her. She
thought of the hedges, with their tender greens; the young
grass studded with gold and silver, for the buttercups
and daisies were gaily blooming; the lilac in the cottage-gardens,
just bursting into exquisite flower; the primroses
with their pale beauty, nestling at the roots of the
trees; the fruit blossom making a poem in delicate
pinks and whites. She looked at the bowl of wild hyacinths
she and Pat had gathered as excitedly as a couple
of Cockney children, and she wished that she could
have stayed in fairyland a little longer. She had been
so happy for a few hours, for she loved the country.
She had put away all the problems that beset her, and
she had let the sweet perfection of Nature soothe her
into something closely resembling peace. She had given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
herself up to its healing, and she was still between it
and noisy nerve-racking London as she donned her
clothes. In accordance with her mood, she had chosen
to wear a simple, almost girlish dress of faint pinks,
that reminded her of the orchards they had passed
through, and, as a finishing touch to remind her of their
excursion, she pinned some primroses on her corsage.
Their delicate perfume was like fresh honey.</p>

<p>Her maid noticed that she looked very young that
night, with the dreams in her eyes and on her lips, even
younger than her twenty-three years. Usually she looked
much older, for her self-possessed manner, inherited
from her mother, her dignified carriage and air of <i lang="fr">savoir
faire</i> might have belonged to a woman of twenty-eight.
To-night she almost had the illusion that she was still
an unmarried girl, with The Great Choice before her.
The soft, warm air seemed to breathe love, to say, “Take
your fill of its sweetness, your life is still to make.” The
impassioned song of the birds, the riot and colour, the
bursting life in bud and blossom, what did it all say, but:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Come, all lovers, to the feasting,</div>
<div class="verse">Where the wine of life is yeasting,</div>
<div class="verse">Soul of human, brute or flower,</div>
<div class="verse">This your purest, fullest hour</div>
<div class="verse">Drink your fill of Love’s own brew.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Even Rhoda Carnegie’s cynical words the previous
evening at the Prime Minister’s dinner-party seemed part
of the day. “Is love to be confined within the small
circlet of a wedding-ring? Why, it would be like trying
to pour the sea into a thimble.” After all, most intelligent
people nowadays scoffed at the wedding-service, with
its “forevers” and “till death.” Those ideas had all
been swept away.</p>

<p>As she rearranged the wild hyacinths for the mere
pleasure of touching them, she asked herself if there still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
lingered any belief in those “forevers.” Honestly, no.
She did realize that love is too big a thing to be confined
within a wedding-ring. It was not that kind of scruple
that held her back. Love, as she had once said before
her marriage, was the only convention she owned. She
recalled the words of James Hinton. “Love, and do as
you please.” Many people had taken this as their text
for lax morality, but they had not understood him rightly.
It was not an easy saying, but a hard one. Love! How
often did one love in a lifetime? She had thought she
loved Gilbert, and she really had at the time. But his
neglect and coldness had killed her love. Could a great
love be killed? “Many waters cannot quench love——”
was that not merely the high standard which we should
all try and uphold, but can never attain to? An impossible
standard, surely, except for rare, ethereal beings
without sexual instincts, strong human needs.</p>

<p>“And I don’t want an ethereal love,” she said aloud.</p>

<p>The dachshund, who had been slumbering peacefully
on the couch, awoke, and looked at her interrogatively.
His faithful soul was afraid she had called him.</p>

<p>“Only talking to myself, Billiken,” she said, smiling
at him. “Why, even you, Billie—I am your little world,
your sun and your moon and your stars, but you like me
to stroke and pat you. Oh, Billie! I must be <em>first</em> with
someone. I don’t belong to anyone really, not of my
own free will, and I want to so much, so much. I’m not
strong enough to stand alone. I don’t want to stand
alone.”</p>

<p>She was first with Frank, the only thing that mattered
in his life. He had told her so often and often. Perhaps,
yes, perhaps she would give herself to him, and make him
happy, make herself happy. Stupid Jack had said that
illicit relations with a man would never make her happy.
But he was an ass, anyway. Why should not Frank
make her happy? Why should Circe’s daughter not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
happy as, apparently, her mother had been? Perhaps
Circe had gone through a similar period of happiness
and hesitation before she—— No, she could not honestly
follow that line of argument. Her mother had only made
a marriage of convenience, her father had never counted
at all, and she knew instinctively, without any harsh
judgment, that Circe had an entirely different nature from
her own. There were no subtle shades of feeling in her
mother, no understanding of intellectual and emotional
heights. Claudia had discovered that as a child. Her
mother never shared her enthusiasm for books or pictures,
she would have looked with but languid interest
that morning at the blue mist of the hyacinths stretching
far away under the trees. Claudia had felt like shouting
as she and Pat turned the corner and saw the beautiful
carpet at their feet, but her mother would only have
feared that she might be getting her feet damp on the
grass. No, the example of Circe taught her nothing.
They were mother and daughter, but they were different.</p>

<p>She went to the window and leaned out, looking up at
the darkly blue sky and the steady stars, which watched
in remote peacefulness over the traffic of Knightsbridge.</p>

<p>Her only justification now or at any time would be the
strength of her love. She had her heritage of passion,
but something that had not restrained her mother would
always restrain her. Did she love Frank? He loved
her, she never doubted that, but did she love him? She
asked herself if the secrecy of such relationship would
not harass her? Would the stolen meetings be the
sweeter for the necessary secrecy, or would there not be
a certain degradation in the whispered rendezvous? She
could hear herself as a girl calling it, with fine youthful
dogmatism, a “hole-and-corner” business. Did love save
it from that reproach?</p>

<p>At the back of her Billie barked sharply, and withdrawing
her head from the window, Claudia heard two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
voices raised in unusual excitement outside her door.
She went across to it and threw it open.</p>

<p>She just caught the end of a sentence spoken by her
husband in his most dictatorial, angry tones. “ ... you
can take a month’s notice. I refuse to overlook the
matter. I have enough affairs on my hands without
keeping a man I cannot rely on. You can go.”</p>

<p>The man, who was an excellent valet, answered with
considerable conviction. “You did not tell me, sir. I
know you did not. You may have thought you did, but
you did not say anything about the suit-case.”</p>

<p>The man went towards the servants’ quarters, and
Gilbert, turning, saw her in the doorway. His face was
very unbeautiful in its anger. He looked almost apoplectic,
his skin was so red and mottled. He had grown
lately to look many years older than his age.</p>

<p>“Gilbert, did I hear you giving Marsh notice to go?
He is such an excellent servant. What has he done?”</p>

<p>He came inside and sat down on the couch, breathing
rather heavily. For a moment he seemed unable to
answer.</p>

<p>“Forgot some instructions I gave him this morning,
and then had the impertinence to say I never gave them.
How”—irritably—“could I forget such an important
thing?”</p>

<p>He was pulling himself together by an effort, but his
mouth twitched.</p>

<p>“Was it very important?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I told him to send my dress-suit to my chambers.
I was going down to a political dinner at Wynnstay”—Wynnstay
was his father’s home—“I thought the bag
was there, and when I went to catch the train—Imbecile!
Most important. I haven’t told you. I expect to stand
for Parliament shortly. Father finds the responsibility
too much, and, of course, the seat is safe.”</p>

<p>“But, Gilbert,” expostulated Claudia, contrary to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
latter custom of listening, if not in agreement, in non-disagreement,
“you have too much to do already. Don’t
you think——”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t rub it in, for heaven’s sake.... Besides,
I’ve promised Neeburg to take a holiday.... I’m certain
I told Marsh about packing my clothes.”</p>

<p>“He is usually very reliable.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well! have it as you like. But <em>any</em> man with
as many things to remember as I have, would be liable
to forget—trifles. Doctors are so ridiculously bigoted.”
His face was slowly becoming an unhealthy white, the
redness was fading away. He looked at her obviously
asking her to agree with him. Neeburg <em>had</em> scared him
a little ... but Neeburg didn’t understand the strain of
a barrister’s work. Claudia was only a woman and, of
course, she wouldn’t understand either.... No good
trying to explain. A long sea voyage ... six months’
rest ... ridiculous! A fortnight at Le Touquet would
set him up ... a man knew his own constitution best.
But perhaps it was just as well he had been prevented
from going to Wynnstay that evening.... He was a
little tired. He would have an early dinner and go to
bed by ten.</p>

<p>He became aware that she was regarding him in a
critical, impersonal way, which, though he was relieved
she had ceased to expect wildly enthusiastic responses
to her exalté moods, somehow annoyed him. No woman,
especially a wife, had any right to look so at a man.</p>

<p>“Why are you staring at me?” he asked, with a frown.</p>

<p>“I was wondering why Nature took the trouble to
bring us together. I have been in the country all day,
and there she seemed so gentle, so beneficent, so sympathetic.
You felt like throwing yourself down among the
daisies on the grass and saying, ‘Take me, everything
you do must be good and wise.’ And in reality Nature
is so cruel, so horribly cruel. Passion is Nature’s greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
force after self-preservation, and I wonder how many
thousands of lives it ruins. I never realized until recently
that ‘Love is cruel as the grave’ meant that.”</p>

<p>“Are you blaming me for our marriage? I never persuaded
you into it against your will.”</p>

<p>“No. Nature persuaded me into it, and Nature made
these soft, delicate primroses.” She touched the flowers
at her breast. “Surely it seems strange that so much
gentle beauty and sordid cruelty should go hand-in-hand?”</p>

<p>He raised his thick, heavy eyebrows. He was feeling
better now. Perhaps, after all, he would go down to
the club on the chance of seeing Mathews about that
case on Tuesday.</p>

<p>“Nature has only one object in bringing men and
women together,” he said slowly. Her words had
reminded him of his father’s and mother’s grievance and
hints. His father had mentioned it when he suggested
giving up his seat in Parliament to him, and made it the
text for a diatribe against the modern woman and her
absent sense of duty. After all, his father was right. A
man ought to have a son. “You know, Claudia, while
we are speaking on this matter, my father and mother
are very disappointed that——”</p>

<p>“Don’t!” she said sharply, the girlish, wistful look gone
from her face. “How can you talk about that—now.
Have you no sense of delicacy—of—of decency——?”
She drew in her breath with a jerk. “Don’t ever speak
again, please, of your parents’ disappointment. I know
you have always considered them before me, but this
is the limit.... You don’t love me—you never did love
me. I will not bear children to a man who does not
love me.”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and rose from the sofa.
She had turned away from him, only her back was
visible. The dress was cut in a low, V-shaped opening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
and there were two pretty dimples that invited a man’s
kisses. But her husband did not notice them, he had
never noticed them, and he saw only the back of a neurotic,
unreasonable woman. He was going towards the
door when she stopped him.</p>

<p>“Gilbert, do you remember that afternoon at Wargrave,
when I asked you if I came first.... I asked if
you loved me a great deal.... Why did you lie to me?
Your work, your ambition, have always come first, and
after the first few months of our marriage, I have meant
nothing to you.” She spoke quite calmly, with none of
the heat and excitement she had shown on the night she
had come back from the Rivingtons. “Gilbert, please
answer a straight question. Why did you tell me that
lie?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a lie. I meant it. Only you women are
so exacting and——”</p>

<p>She slowly inclined her head.</p>

<p>“I see. Perhaps you weren’t aware at the time it was
a lie. You never have analysed your emotions. You
meant it—at the moment. Passion had got both of us
by the throat. I loved you, but although I didn’t realize
it, passion blinded my eyes to your real character and
how unsuitable we were to one another. And passion
urged you on to marry me, when you ought to have
married a nice, tame woman who would have been content
with occasional crumbs. Oh! why does Nature
bring the wrong people together! Why! Why! Gilbert,
I wish we had been lovers instead of husband and wife,
then—then the mistake would not have been irrevocable.”</p>

<p>He was genuinely shocked. “Claudia, I would rather
not listen to such things. Really, the licence women
allow themselves nowadays—— I can’t think how such
ideas enter your head.”</p>

<p>She smiled, with a touch of amusement as well as a
tinge of sadness, as she answered him:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>“All sorts of unorthodox ideas get into women’s heads
nowadays. I know you can’t understand, and that’s the
trouble. You were made one way and I another, and
then there came a whirlwind and threw us together.”
She held out her hand. “Don’t let’s quarrel any more.
I begin to see things more clearly.... I was cheated by
Nature, not by you. But ... certain things you were—going
to speak about, are quite impossible. Those days
are gone for ever. We must each in our own way make
the best of the remainder of our life.... Have you
decided to go to Le Touquet at once?”</p>

<p>He was puzzled by her new attitude and the calmness
of the frank brown eyes that confronted him.</p>

<p>“Yes, I promised Fritz to get away as soon as possible.
I’ve asked Colin to go over with me. I knew you
wouldn’t want to leave town just now, at the beginning
of the season.” He had not considered the possibility
of her going with him, but something in her new, almost
friendly, attitude, made him add the last sentence.</p>

<p>“I will come if you wish it, Gilbert.”</p>

<p>He hesitated. She played golf much better than he.
So did Colin, but that was different. The primitive man
was strong in Gilbert.</p>

<p>“I think it’s hardly worth while disarranging your plans.
You’ve got heaps of engagements, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but——”</p>

<p>“If Colin can come, we’ll just take it quietly; golf
all day and go to bed early. A fortnight of that will
soon pick me up. Later on in the summer we’ll go for
a holiday together.”</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>He went towards the door again, and Claudia picked
up a light wrap for her shoulders. She would be rather
late for Frank’s dinner-party.</p>

<p>At the door he fidgeted with the handle and finally
turned to her. “Perhaps I did forget to tell Marsh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Claudia. Smooth him over, will you? You’re good at
that kind of thing. Tell him that—er—I’ve come to the
conclusion that—he didn’t hear me.”</p>

<p>It was on the tip of her tongue to ask him why he did
not tell Marsh himself. Then she remembered her newborn
resolution, and let him go his own road.</p>

<p>“I’ll see what I can do in the morning. Good-night,
Gilbert.”</p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE GREAT THRESHOLD</span></h3>

<p>The small dining-room of Frank’s studio-flat had
that cosy, friendly air that only a small room can
achieve. That there was little more space than was
occupied by the table laid for four only seemed to increase
the pleasantness of the apartment, which was lit
by four red candles in old pewter candlesticks on the
table. Their red shades confined the circle of light to
the white tablecloth, and allowed the rest of the room
to appear pleasantly soft and vague. An enormous bowl
of red roses filled the centre of the table, and some of
their broken petals were scattered over the cloth, while
an Eastern scarf of some filmy material shading from
orange to blood-red was loosely disposed with an air of
artistic negligence around the centre bowl.</p>

<p>Frank Hamilton looked down at his handiwork and
found it good. But still he fidgeted with the back of a
chair as he surveyed it, and his eyes were bright with
some mental or physical excitement. He was not often
restless, but to-night his nerves were evidently on edge.
His teeth gnawed his lower lip and his eyes constantly
sought the clock.</p>

<p>Then, after giving a last touch to the table, he pulled
out a bunch of keys from his pocket and unlocked a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
corner cupboard where he kept liqueurs and wines. He
never forgot to lock that cupboard, no matter how late
his company left or how high his visions had soared, for
he had a great mistrust of servants. His usual manner
was half dreamy, rather abstracted, as though the sordid
details of everyday life passed him by, but the impression
that he gave was misleading. Often his mind was most
practical when his eyes seemed only to hold vague dreams
and beautiful, unworldly ideals, and if anyone thought
to drive an easy bargain at such a time he found himself
mistaken. As a child at school Frank had always
managed to elude just punishment by that same manner
of aloofness from desks and copybooks, and from quite
early manhood women had taught him to realize how
that air, combined with obvious good looks and the reputation
for “temperament,” could be made valuable. The
way in which his eyes would light up with sudden enthusiasm,
the frank expressions of admiration which came
easily to his lips, the appeal which he made by a seemingly
exclusive devotion to the woman of the moment,
had always made him a favourite with the fair sex, who
contrasted him with the more phlegmatic males of their
acquaintance to his great advantage, for “it’s the high-falutin
stuff the women bite on.”</p>

<p>Men did not like Frank Hamilton, and he was seldom
seen in their company. A few artists dropped in on him
occasionally to talk “shop,” but they were never heard
to speak of him with any enthusiasm. Indeed, among
them he had the reputation for being “close,” and that
happy-go-lucky, jovial crowd that lends and borrows with
equal ease found this unforgivable. He was not willing
to “part,” nor did he try to put commissions in their
way, and lately, as de Bleriot had been heard to say at
the Chelsea Arts Club, “Hamilton’s getting altogether
too big for his boots.”</p>

<p>After Frank had put the liqueurs on the sideboard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
he noticed that the card which had been attached to the
bunch of roses he had just arranged had fallen to the
ground. He picked it up and re-read it with a little
smile of amusement.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To the greatest of artists and my dear friend. M.J.”</p>

</div>

<p>With a laugh, he tore it up into fragments and threw
the pieces in the fire. “Maria Jacobs! Maria Jacobs!
Well, the roses have come in handy”—mockingly—“thank
you, Maria.”</p>

<p>As the last fragment was consumed, the door-bell rang,
and he went out into the hall to receive his visitor.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I am a little late,” apologized Claudia,
letting him take her cloak, “but—— Oh, well! the
Bridgemans are later, it seems, so I shan’t apologize any
more.”</p>

<p>He drew her into the dining-room and kissed her.</p>

<p>“Don’t! You are crushing the poor primroses. Are
they not sweet? Don’t you love the frailty and delicate
sweetness of wild flowers?”</p>

<p>She was very sweet herself as she said it, her eyes
taking in approvingly the decorations of the table. But
she was also to him still a little <i lang="fr">grande dame</i>, with her
dignified carriage and her head held high. For a moment
doubt knocked at his confident heart. It would all depend
how she took his news. The next few minutes
would decide his fate.</p>

<p>“Claudia, I have a disappointment for you. I have
just had a wire from the Bridgemans. She is ill and they
cannot come.” He was watching her narrowly, although
the words were spoken easily enough. “There was no
time to get another couple. The wire arrived a few
minutes ago. You can see the table is set for them.
Do you mind, dearest?”</p>

<p>For a moment she hesitated. She had a curious sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
feeling of fright, like someone who sees a gate closing
behind her.</p>

<p>“Of course,” he said lightly, “it’s not quite <i lang="fr">comme
il faut</i>, but neither you nor I care about that, do we?
We will go to a restaurant if you prefer. It’s a pity the
Bridgemans didn’t let me know sooner.”</p>

<p>The room was very cozy and inviting. The situation
was compromising; but then, as Frank said, did she care
about small conventionalities? No one would know. It
was only Mother Grundy who would drive them forth
to a noisy, rag-time restaurant where they would hardly
be able to hear one another speak. The country air had
made her agreeably tired, so that the mellow light of the
candles and the room perched high above the traffic appealed
to her mood. Had he made the least attempt to
persuade her she would not have stayed, but he was
wise enough to make it seem a matter of indifference
where they dined so long as they were together.</p>

<p>“I’m tired of the clatter of restaurants,” she said,
sinking into a chair by the hearth; “and I smell a smell
of savoury baked meats. It’s very peaceful here at
night.”</p>

<p>“Marshall isn’t at all a bad cook,” returned Frank
lightly, “and I told her to think out a specially nice
dinner.”</p>

<p>“For the Bridgemans or—for me?”</p>

<p>The momentary sensation of panic had passed. He
was just as he always was, devoted, deferential, entirely
at her command.</p>

<p>“For the Bridgemans, of course. Need you ask?” He
took the pretty arm lying on the arm of the chair and
let his lips gently slip along the skin from the elbow to
the wrist. “Claudia, I can’t think of anyone but you
these days.”</p>

<p>“Just an infatuation!” she laughed provocatively, a
thrill running through her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you sorry that I am so infatuated? Would you
have me more cool and reasonable? You told me once that
you hated tepid people. Have you changed your ideas?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then why—— Ah! here is the soup. <i lang="fr">Madame est
servie.</i> Will she graciously adorn this chair?”</p>

<p>“How charming! It’s Jacobean, isn’t it? I shall enjoy
sitting in it.”</p>

<p>Part of the face was in shadow, but the light fell full
on the soft, curving lips, very sweet and gracious to-night,
the firm, well-moulded chin, and the exquisite line
of the bare neck and shoulders.</p>

<p>“Do you know any of the other tenants in the building,
Frank?” she asked over her soup.</p>

<p>“No. Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Colin Paton knows an architect further down,
Leonard Gost. I wonder if you knew him too.”</p>

<p>Frank shook his head. “No, but I happened to hear
this morning that he had been suddenly taken ill. The
doctor came here by mistake. Don’t let’s talk about
Paton.”</p>

<p>“Why? Don’t you like him?”</p>

<p>“I’m jealous of every man you even see. That day I
came in and found him holding your hand I could have
slain him.”</p>

<p>She smiled, and then the smile suddenly vanished and
was replaced by a more thoughtful expression.</p>

<p>“Are you, then, jealous of my husband?” she asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>The question was unexpected, and for a moment he
had no answer ready.</p>

<p>“Why, yes; of course, I——”</p>

<p>“No, I see you are not. How curious! I think if
I were in love with a married woman I should be morbidly
jealous of her husband. My imagination would
torture me, the grey matter in my brain would turn a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
bright orange with jealous hate.” She had never spoken
to him of her relations with her husband. He had never
asked any questions, and she had volunteered no information.
But sometimes she had wondered that Frank could
take his existence and rights so calmly.</p>

<p>“But you do not love him,” objected Frank; “if you
loved him I should hate him.”</p>

<p>“I did love him—once.”</p>

<p>“A man who has failed to keep his wife’s love deserves
to lose it,” said Frank glibly, who was opening the
champagne.</p>

<p>“Frank, you say you love me. Suppose I said I was
tired of the life I lead, that there is something in me
that shrinks from deception, that I like all the cards on
the table. Would you take me away?”</p>

<p>The cork popped loudly at the moment, and he had to
quickly pour some of the champagne into her glass.</p>

<p>“Darling, I should only be too proud. You ought to
know that.”</p>

<p>Was it his preoccupation with the champagne, or was
there something wrong with his tone or his words? What
had she expected him to say? Then she pulled herself
together with a laugh.</p>

<p>“To love is human, to marry—sometimes divine. Don’t
be afraid, <i lang="fr">mon ami</i>. I’m not cut out for those heroics,
or,” she added, “you either.”</p>

<p>He was inwardly relieved, for a man could never be
sure what a highly-strung, emotional woman like Claudia
would expect of him. She was adorable, she was well-born
and clever, but—no, he was not cut out for
“heroics.” As much as he could be, he was desperately
in love with her; it was perfectly true that the thought
of her obsessed his days and nights. But love to him
was a pleasant thing, a serious light-mindedness in which
a little pretence was necessary on either side. They
might sigh together over the impossibility of spending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
their lives together; they might regret that they had not
met before she entered into the legal compact; they might
even indulge in rosy dreams of a future if she “ever
became free,” but they would be very careful not to endanger
her reputation or cause her spouse to set her free.
Bourgeois born, reared among ideals of hypocritical respectability,
Frank Hamilton had secretly a horror of
anything <i lang="fr">outré</i>, such as the Divorce Court. It would
probably make very little difference to his career as an artist,
but his innate conventionality revolted at the thought.</p>

<p>“If you would trust yourself to me, I would try and
prove worthy of your bounty,” he said humbly. “My
dearest, you wring my heart by these doubts of me. Don’t
you <em>yet</em> believe in my love?”</p>

<p>She was playing with the wing of a chicken.</p>

<p>“How can one tell love from passion? Do you
know?”</p>

<p>“I’ll ask you a question. Do you believe that love
between a young normal woman and man can exist without
passion?”</p>

<p>His eyes challenged hers over the deep red roses.
There was a little flush on her creamy cheeks now, and
the primroses were fading whitely at her breast. There
was a current of electricity in the little room going from
him to her. She fancied she could almost hear the
beating of the wings.</p>

<p>“No, passion must be part of love.”</p>

<p>“And you wouldn’t care for a man who was content
merely to love you at a respectful distance? No, you
needn’t answer. I know you wouldn’t. You’re much too
alive for that. You are much too passionate. A placid,
hold-my-hand love would never make you happy....
Shall we have coffee upstairs in the studio?”</p>

<p>She nodded. The atmosphere of the little room seemed
to have become too close. She was aware that her checks
were burning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>She knew that she stood on the Great Threshold. It
was only fair to Frank that she should decide to-night.
She knew by this time enough of men to realize that self-repression,
self-control are foreign to their nature and
upbringing. She was content, or she could have forced
herself to be content, with the indefinite relations between
them. Something urged her across the threshold, and
yet something that she could not grasp or define held
her back. She remembered a phrase from a play she had
seen a few days previously, in which a man had spoken
of “woman’s innate purity.” Could she lay claim to
such a possession? Clearly, no. She had dallied with
the idea, she had let Frank kiss her time and again
without any repugnance. A pure-minded woman would
have repulsed him at the outset. She would have said,
“I am a married woman. Only my husband has a right
to my caresses.”</p>

<p>“I have forgotten the cigarettes. I’ll run down for
them, if you’ll excuse me a minute.”</p>

<p>She nodded as she made herself comfortable on the
low divan covered with cushions.</p>

<p>The Great Threshold! Her heart beat faster as she
contemplated it. She wondered in what fashion the
married women she knew had stepped across it—gaily,
impulsively, with reckless abandonment, with inward
shrinking, with cool deliberation—how? La Rochefoucauld
once said, “Some ladies may be met with who
never had any intrigue at all, but it will be exceedingly
hard to find any who have had one and no more,” but
then, he was only a maxim-monger, and the making of
maxims, like the making of epigrams, is only a trick.
If she crossed it, there would only be Frank. They
would love one another secretly, and the stolen hours
together would make her barren life more tolerable.
Jack had made out that <i lang="fr">liaisons</i> were nothing more than
licentious flirtations. If two people really loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>——</p>

<p>Moved by a restless spirit, she rose and went over to
the mantelpiece. Her eyes fell with a start on a visiting-card
inscribed <span class="smcapuc">COLIN PATON</span>.</p>

<p>Her hands fell nervelessly to her sides. Somehow
there seemed a third person in the room. Frank came
back and handed her the box of cigarettes.</p>

<p>She indicated the card.</p>

<p>“Mr. Paton—has been here?... Thank you.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I asked him to come some time, and he came
to-day. He said he wanted to see how your portrait was
getting on.”</p>

<p>“What did he say about it?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t show it to him,” said Frank, with a touch
of arrogance. “Besides, it isn’t quite finished, and no
artist likes to expose an unfinished picture.”</p>

<p>“It’s practically finished. I needn’t come any more
for it?”</p>

<p>“We won’t tell people it’s finished,” he whispered, close
to her ear. “We will pretend it is still only half-finished.”</p>

<p>The words jarred, and she drew away from him. Yet
he was quite right. If she crossed the threshold, she
must in future take refuge in such subterfuges. She
must lie to everyone, to honest Pat, to Colin Paton—— Her
brows met in a frown. Could love thrive in such
an atmosphere? Frank seemed to have thought the
whole thing out, counted on her surrender—How dared
he?—and yet—She had certainly encouraged him, there
was no gainsaying that.</p>

<p>“Let us look at the picture again,” she said abruptly.
“I’d like to see it by nightlight.”</p>

<p>With a smile he complied, classing her with the other
vain women who had sat to him. She wanted to look on
her own beauty. He pulled forward the easel and took
off the cloth.</p>

<p>It was one of the best bits of painting he had ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
done. He had worked hard on it, and it had but slightly
the faults that usually marred his work. He had put
in careful, conscientious brush-work; and in combination
with the arresting individuality of the sitter, the result
was one of which he might justly be proud.</p>

<p>But as Claudia gazed on it, dissatisfaction stirred within
her. The yellowish lights—the electric globes were
of some daffodil tint—made her see it as she had never
done before. The eyes were surely too ardent, the curve
of the lips too sensual, the whole face had a curious
voluptuousness that made her recoil from the picture.
Did she give people that impression?</p>

<p>“Is it—exactly like me?” she asked.</p>

<p>“It’s as I see you,” he said complacently. “My beautiful
Claudia! It is good, isn’t it? I think it will create
a sensation when it is exhibited.”</p>

<p>Suddenly she knew that she hated it, that she did not
want the world to see it, to stare at it, to comment on
it. Yes, she was glad Colin had not seen it. He might
have thought——</p>

<p>“I don’t like it.”</p>

<p>If she had suddenly held a pistol at his head he could
not have been more surprised. He turned from his very
self-satisfied contemplation of the picture and stared at
the original. And it was not the woman of the portrait
he saw, nor the flushed, hesitating woman of the dinner-table,
but a woman whose eyes were wide open and
startled, as though some new aspect of life had struck
her; a woman who was fighting for self-mastery, calling
to her aid that pride and moral fastidiousness that were
innate in her, and which lately she had been trying to
keep out of sight.</p>

<p>She was not the woman, she told herself, she never
would be the woman of the picture. That was not a
woman with true love and passion in her eyes, it was
mere animal sensuality. Yet she was aware that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
might become that woman if she crossed the threshold.
Dare she take the risk? Did she want to take the risk?</p>

<p>“I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>She had never heard him speak so angrily. Yes, he
was really angry. His artistic pride was wounded.</p>

<p>“It’s very clever, very clever,” she stammered, “but I—I
don’t like the way you have depicted me. It isn’t
the nicest—me.”</p>

<p>His eyes were very light and very cold as he faced
her, and suddenly they seemed to be bright and shallow,
like those of a bird. His lips made a thin red line, and
a hardness of the lines of the jaw became noticeable.</p>

<p>“Frank, don’t you understand?” she pleaded. “There,
in the picture, you have made me an <i lang="fr">amoureuse</i>, <i lang="fr">une
grande amoureuse</i>, and I—I don’t think I’m really that.”
Then a little wildly—“It may be in me, I may have it in
my blood, but I don’t want it to come out.... I’m
sorry, Frank, but I don’t like it.”</p>

<p>She saw, as she looked in his face, that he did not
understand, that she could never make him understand.
She had mortally wounded his pride. He would never
forgive the thrust.</p>

<p>Without a word he noisily pushed back the easel.
Mechanically she sank down on the divan again, and as
she disturbed one of the cushions, a piece of paper became
uncovered. Before she realized that it might be private,
her eyes had taken in the wording. It was the
Bridgemans’ telegram—“Sorry wife ill. Cannot come to-morrow.
<span class="smcap">Bridgeman.</span>”</p>

<p>With a last kick the easel was lodged in its place
against the wall. She put the cushion over the telegram
again, as he came back to the centre of the room like a
sulky child, a cigarette drooping at the corner of his
mouth.</p>

<p>“You’re extremely difficult to please,” he said sarcastically.
“I’m glad all my sitters are not so particular.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
You can’t say I haven’t done full justice to your looks.”</p>

<p>That was all he could make out of her explanation, her
confession! It was a shock, but it had the effect of
steadying her. Her voice was very quiet and composed
as she replied:</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind, Frank, I won’t have the picture
exhibited. After all, a portrait is a personal thing. Send
it home to me as soon as it is finished.” She wanted to
add “and I will send you a cheque for it,” but she was
afraid of hurting his feelings. Nothing had ever been
said about payment. It had been tacitly assumed that
it was a labour of love.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it’s fair to me,” he protested, still sulky,
the man submerged in the artist. “It’s the best picture
I have ever done. No woman can judge her own portrait.
Besides, you never objected to it before.”</p>

<p>“I always saw it quite close at hand and in the light
of day. To-night, at the end of the room, it looks
different.”</p>

<p>“Well, commend me to women-sitters for changeability!”
he exclaimed bitterly.</p>

<p>She put her hand on the cushion that concealed the
telegram. He had evidently been sitting in her position
when it arrived.</p>

<p>“Perhaps—if the Bridgemans had come—they might
have liked it, and their opinion is more valuable than
mine. You only heard of her illness this evening?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he responded moodily, “just before you came
in.”</p>

<p>Petty trickery! She had nearly lent herself to that.
Afterwards—yes, circumstances might have made it
necessary, but before—— It was not, and it never could
have been, love on either side. Love was a bigger, finer
thing than that! Perhaps too large always to be confined
within a wedding-ring, but this did not of itself
overleap the bounds. Only the trickster passion again!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
And passion she had proved to be a cheat, a miserable,
mean cheat, that preyed on the emotions and ignorance
of women.</p>

<p>She suddenly felt very tired, and her face had gone
pathetically white as she rose from the divan.</p>

<p>“Frank, I am sorry I have hurt your feelings. I can
only say again that I admire it as a piece of painting,
immensely.... Now I must go home. It is getting
rather late, and I think a day in the country tires one,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>Suddenly the <em>man</em> overcame the vanity of the artist.
His eyes changed, and before she could stop him he had
crushed her in his arms.</p>

<p>“Never mind about the picture ... it’s you I want and
<em>must have</em>.... I love you to distraction.... Claudia,
you can’t hesitate any longer.... It’s Kismet, stronger
than both of us.”</p>

<p>She knew it would only be an unseemly scuffle if she
struggled, a scuffle that would abase her pride still
further. She remained cold and lifeless in his arms, until
at last he released her and looked into her face with
alarm.</p>

<p>“Claudia, you’re not going—you shan’t go——”</p>

<p>“Frank,” she said clearly, but without an atom of fear
in her eyes, “I apologize to you. I know I’ve what you
men call ‘encouraged you.’ You have the right to be
angry with me, only if you love me—don’t.... I—I
thought I could.... I am very unhappy.... I didn’t
know myself until to-night.... There’s something that
won’t let me cross the threshold.... I’m not good, and
I’m not afraid of convention, but I can’t do it.... I
should wake up to hate myself. It’s as well I found out
in time—for you and for me.”</p>

<p>“You say you’re not afraid. You <em>are</em> afraid,” he said.</p>

<p>“I said I was not afraid of convention. It’s true I
am afraid of something—in myself. I thought it was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
easy game to play. Now I wonder how a woman can
play it.... Let me go now, Frank. I’m very tired.”</p>

<p>“You don’t love me?”</p>

<p>“No ... not that way?”</p>

<p>Her quiet voice, her steady eyes, frightened him. He
knew he was playing a losing game, and he began to
bluster.</p>

<p>“You would love me ... you practically promised me
everything ... you’ve just amused yourself with me, like
other women in your set ... you run up an account, and
you don’t pay the bill ... if you were a man I should
call it damned dishonourable, but as you are a
woman——”</p>

<p>She stooped and drew forth the telegram.</p>

<p>“And if I were a man, what should I call this?”</p>

<p>The paper dropped from her hand and fluttered to the
ground, where it lay between them.</p>

<p>“It was through love of you,” he said desperately.
“You shilly-shallied ... women always have ridiculous
scruples.... I swear it was through love of you.
You’ve driven me out of my wits.”</p>

<p>She shook her head. There was no anger on her lips,
only a drooping sadness.</p>

<p>“I wonder if that’s all a man’s love can ever mean....
I wonder! Good-night, Frank. Let’s close this
chapter—friends. There have been faults on both
sides.”</p>

<p>She held out her hand, but he turned away and flung
himself on the divan with his head in his cushions.</p>

<p>She waited a moment, and then she went out of the
door and down the stairs that led to the living-rooms
below. Surely he would see her out? Would not Mrs.
Marshall think it curious that she should depart in such
an odd fashion? What a ludicrous finish to the evening!</p>

<p>The hall below was in darkness. She could see no light
from the region of the kitchen. Was that, too, part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
his experienced manœuvring? She shivered, and groped
for the electric switch. After some time she found it.
Her cloak was lying on one of the hall chairs.</p>

<p>Was he going to let her depart alone? How would
she get a taxi? It was half past eleven. Oh! how tired
she felt now. Her feet seemed leaden as she slipped
the cloak round her shoulders. She cast one more glance
up at the door of the studio. But it remained closed.
His manners, with his hopes of her favours, had forsaken
him. There had been something in Rhoda Carnegie’s
remarks, after all.</p>

<p>She opened the hall-door, and found the stone stairs
only very dimly lit. She went heavily down them, forgetting
that she might have summoned the lift. Her
soft pink dress trailed after her, for she was too tired
to hold it up. How unending the stairs were! Would
she ever get to the bottom? How many flights was it—six?</p>

<p>It seemed to her that she had been plodding down
the stairs for ages, when suddenly a hall-door opened
just as she was rounding a turn of the staircase. A
voice said quietly, “I’ll come in to-morrow morning to
see how he is getting on.”</p>

<p>She had unconsciously shrunk back against the wall
among the shadows, but at the recognition of his voice
she exclaimed, she thought in a whisper, “Colin!”</p>

<p>He stopped in the act of running down the stairs, and
came back. But now she had no volition left to move
backwards or forwards. He groped up the stairs, and
saw the gleam of a diamond spray on her corsage. He
went nearer and saw her.</p>

<p>“Claudia!... Claudia!” The first “Claudia” was
pure astonishment, but the second held something more,
something that seemed to match the look in his eyes
when he had been watching her flirting with Frank at
her mother’s “at home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>“Colin,” she said pitifully, “I’m so tired ... take me
home ... please, take me home....”</p>

<p>She stumbled a little, and he quietly put her hand
through his arm.</p>

<p>“It’s not worth summoning the lift ... it’s only two
flights; lean on my arm.”</p>

<p>She leaned more heavily than she knew, for all her
spirit had gone, her springy step had deserted her, her
head drooped sideways.</p>

<p>Luckily there was a taxi passing, and in a few minutes
she found herself beside him on the narrow seat. For a
moment she sat motionless, hardly realizing his presence.
Then, with a childish impulse for comfort, she put her
head on his shoulder, and commenced to sob.</p>

<p>“Colin, don’t think things.... I want to explain....”</p>

<p>His hand closed firmly over her cold one, cold, though
the night was quite hot.</p>

<p>“Claudia, don’t ... there’s no need ... what are friends
for?”</p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="smaller">DRUNK AND DISORDERLY</span></h3>

<p>Claudia had slept but little that night, her thoughts
going over the scene in the studio again and again,
sometimes accusing herself, sometimes wondering at herself.
One fact stood out clearly. Frank had not loved
her, nor she him. What had Colin thought when he
found her crouching on the stairs? She had offered to
explain—but what could she have said?</p>

<p>With weary eyes and pale cheeks she took the letters
from her maid’s hand. She was almost too tired to open
them, but as the letters fell loosely on the coverlet, she
saw one in Colin’s handwriting. With her heart beating
fast, she picked it up and tore it open. For a moment she
forgot that it had probably been posted before he brought
her home from the studio.</p>

<p>A letter and some printed matter fell out. She picked
up the printed matter first. It was a page proof of a
book, containing a dedication to herself. She read it with
a queer feeling, but her apathy had gone.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">To my Friend, Claudia Currey</span>,</p>

<p>whose sympathy and friendship have inspired me to
put down on paper some facts I have been able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
gather, together with some purely personal views on
that most baffling and fascinating of all subjects—sociology.
I beg her to accept the dedication of this
book, with all its faults and shortcomings, of which
the author is painfully aware, in memory of our
many talks about ‘humans.’”</p>

</div>

<p>Her eyes filled with tears, and she could hardly read
the letter that accompanied the page.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Claudia</span>,” it ran, “I was horribly disappointed,
childishly disappointed the other day when you
told me you had heard about my forthcoming book. I
think you must have got it from some inside source, for it
is not yet announced to the public. I wanted the enclosed
to be a surprise to you, and now the squib won’t go off!
I asked and obtained Gilbert’s permission to put in this
little dedication, because you really did inspire it. You
always liked people who ‘did things,’ and your interest
in life and ‘humans’ quickened mine. How dare you say
you will order a copy as soon as it is out? You <em>know</em>
you’ll get an advance copy, the very first. I do hope you
will like it, at least, a little. Now it is in print, I realize
what a little I have been able to say on a vast subject.
All I can say in extenuation is, I’ve done my best, though
perhaps I don’t deserve any marks for that. But it’s
such a huge field to try and cover. Do you remember
when you asked me for a book on the subject and I gave
you Lecky’s ‘History of European Morals’? I’ve always
been cheered by your remark after reading it. ‘Only a
Methusaleh could hope to come to any definite conclusions,
and then he might be ready to lie down and die!’</p>

<p>“There are no definite conclusions in my book, because
I try hard to keep my mind plastic. Some day, when I’m
a greybeard with stooping shoulders and several deaf
ears, perhaps I’ll do something better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m sending you a new ‘Lear Nonsense’ book. Rather
jolly, I think. Do look at the picture of the German and
the baby who is <i lang="de">gedroppen</i>.</p>

<p class="center">“Always your admiring friend,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Colin Paton</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>The other letters lay unheeded. She dropped back
among the pillows, and there was no movement of the
head, or even the hand in which lay the letter. She might
have been asleep.</p>

<p>But when her maid, whose face betokened hesitation
and perplexity, came in quietly, Claudia turned and
opened her dark eyes. There were no tears in them, only
a burning, unfathomable look which, though it envisaged
Johnson clearly, did not notice her perturbed face.</p>

<p>“Madam, I——” began Johnson, clearing her throat.
“Did the master tell you he would not be coming home
last night?”</p>

<p>Claudia came back from a remote distance.</p>

<p>“Last night? No. He was only going to his club, I
believe. Why, has he not slept in the flat?”</p>

<p>“No, madam, and he did not say anything about stopping
out to Marsh, and he didn’t have his bag packed.
He thought he had told Marsh to pack it for him to go
down to Wynnstay, but Marsh says——”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember. Perhaps he went down to Wynnstay,
after all, rather late.” It had never happened before
that Gilbert had been away from the flat without
informing her or the servants; but Claudia saw nothing
remarkable in the oversight.</p>

<p>“Marsh thought so too, madam, and he got a trunk
call through to Wynnstay, but he has not been there, and
then he telephoned the club and—and they told him Mr.
Currey was there last night and left about twelve o’clock.
I—we thought we had better mention it, madam.”</p>

<p>Claudia was roused to attention this time. Where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
could Gilbert have got to after he left the club? There
were some wives, she knew, who would have dismissed
the matter with a shrug of their shoulders, but she had
no complaint of Gilbert on that score. Perhaps he would
have been more human and companionable had he had
some of the weaknesses of the flesh.</p>

<p>She looked at the clock. It was half-past nine. He
was generally down at his chambers soon after nine.</p>

<p>“Was he in evening-dress, Johnson, when he went out
last night?”</p>

<p>“Yes, madam; Marsh said he changed before he went
out, and told him he was going to bed early, as he
had a big case on to-day and wanted to be fresh for it.”</p>

<p>Johnson looked at her for instructions, but Claudia
knit her brows in perplexity. It was very curious, but
it did not occur to her that there was anything seriously
wrong. He must have gone home with some friend and
turned in for the night. And yet—he had never done
any such thing. He was essentially a man of routine
and order.</p>

<p>“I don’t think there is anything to be done, Johnson,”
said Claudia, after a little thought. “Probably they will
ring up from his office to say he has arrived all right.
Ring them again and ask them to telephone immediately
Mr. Currey comes in. And bring my coffee, please.”</p>

<p>But when she had finished her coffee and toast there
was still no word from the office, except that they had
rung up rather agitatedly to know if Mrs. Currey had any
idea where he could be found. By this time Claudia had
become impressed with the idea that something was
wrong. One was always hearing of motor accidents nowadays.
Could anything of the kind have happened to
Gilbert?</p>

<p>Instinctively she turned to Colin Paton in the
emergency. After they had silently bade one another
good-bye last night she had thought she could never face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
him again, for if he did not think the worst of her he
must have guessed that there had been some kind of a
scene that had upset her. And on the top of it all his
charming letter.</p>

<p>But this happening made her put her own <i lang="fr">affaires du
cœur</i> on one side. If anything had happened to Gilbert,
Colin would be able to find it out. She hardly realized
how blind her faith in Colin was. She went to the
telephone in her dressing-gown and called him up.</p>

<p>“Colin! Oh! I am so glad you are there. I don’t
know whether I ought to be alarmed or not, but Gilbert
has not been home since eight o’clock last night, and he
is not at the office. He took no suit-case out with him,
and he was seen to leave the club at twelve o’clock.
What ought I to do?”</p>

<p>He answered her quite quietly, asking a few more questions;
but she knew his voice so well by now that she
realized that he did not consider her an alarmist in ringing
him up.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry. I’ll go to the club and make some inquiries,
and telephone you later. Leave it to me.”</p>

<p>“What do you think——?” she began timidly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. But we must find him. I’ll keep in
touch with you. Don’t be alarmed, Claudia.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she replied humbly. “You—you are
always very good to me.”</p>

<p>There was a slight pause at the other end. “Don’t
talk nonsense. When will you learn the meaning of
friendship?”</p>

<p>She went back to her dressing feeling more comforted,
for the mere fact of having confided a trouble to him
always seemed to halve it. He was essentially a man
who inspired confidence, and Claudia wondered vaguely,
as she brushed her hair, why some men were like that and
others were not. His opinion was always sought after by
his friends and acquaintances, and yet he never gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
it in any ponderous spirit. Sometimes he replied with a
joke, or a happy allusion, but he gave an answer all the
same. This reminded her of Patricia, who had said
enthusiastically a few days previously, “He’s the most
helpful man I ever knew.” Lately Pat had seen a good
deal of him, and one or two people had remarked on it
to Claudia, saying, “Is Pat going to settle down at
last?”</p>

<p>Was Colin Paton in love with Pat? What else could
be the meaning of their frequent meetings and that
seclusion in the library? She, Claudia, was only a great
friend, and the little prick of jealousy she acknowledged
to her self that she felt was natural to women where their
men friends were concerned. All women hated losing
their men friends by marriage. And—yes—Pat would
make a charming wife if she fell in love.</p>

<p>It was eleven o’clock—Gilbert’s case was on—and he
had made no appearance. This much had just been telephoned
from his office. Claudia was sure now that something
was seriously amiss. For Gilbert to neglect his
work, some accident must have happened.</p>

<p>She felt a restless desire to do something, to search for
him herself; but what could she do? Where could he be?
Could he be lying in one of the great hospitals, unable
to give an account of himself?</p>

<p>Johnson came hurrying in. “Madam, Mr. Paton is on
the telephone and wants to speak to you.”</p>

<p>Claudia flew to the receiver.</p>

<p>“Claudia, is that you? It’s all right, I’ve got him
safe and sound. No, he’s not hurt. I’ll tell you more
when I see you. I am bringing him back now. It’s a
case of complete loss of memory; spent the night in the
police cells as a drunk and disorderly—he must have been
very excited. He is still dazed and suspicious of everyone.
Don’t show there is anything amiss. Keep quite
calm, and telephone Dr. Neeburg.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>Gilbert locked up in the police-cells as drunk and disorderly!
It was unbelievable! It was too ironic!
Though she no longer loved him, her heart was touched
by pity for him. He must have known where he was,
although he could not remember his name. What an
awful time he must have had!</p>

<p>But she immediately rang up Fritz Neeburg, who, she
noted, did not seem startled at the news. He said he
would come immediately. “I was afraid of something
like this, Mrs. Currey,” he concluded.</p>

<p>The strong constitution of which Gilbert had always
boasted had given way. His pride would be in the dust.
It would mean giving up work for some time. It meant
a very bad break.</p>

<p>Claudia was appalled when she saw the man who got
out of the taxi with Colin. No man looks well after a
night spent in his clothes, but Gilbert’s appearance had
a wildness and dishevelment which was as much due to
the brain as the body. His eyes were bloodshot, there
was a strong growth of hair on his chin which showed
conspicuously, his shirt-front was rumpled and crushed
as she had never seen any front, his mouth kept twitching
and his walk was unsteady. But Claudia controlled her
alarm and went forward with a smile.</p>

<p>“You’ll like some breakfast, won’t you, Gilbert? Marsh
has got some nice hot coffee for you in the dining-room.”</p>

<p>Neeburg had not arrived, and she had not known what
preparations to make, but she wanted to appear natural.</p>

<p>Gilbert looked at her with a curious indifference; she
could not make out if he knew her or not.</p>

<p>“I think you’d like a bath first, old man, wouldn’t
you?” said Colin cheerfully. “And some fresh clothes.
This garb is unseemly in the morning.”</p>

<p>He allowed Colin to lead him up the stairs, and in a
few minutes Neeburg arrived and went after him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>In half an hour the two men came down together.
“We’ve put him to bed, Mrs. Currey,” said Neeburg,
“with a sleeping-draught. He’ll probably sleep twelve
hours or so. That’s the best thing for him at present.
He may wake up with his mind quite clear. It’s a case
of mental aphasia, due to nerve-strain. I’ve given him
the clearest warnings time after time. I’m very sorry,
but he has brought it on himself.”</p>

<p>“He had made up his mind to go to Le Touquet next
week,” said Claudia. She looked at Colin. “You were
going with him, were you not?”</p>

<p>“He asked me, and I was trying to make arrangements.
Can he go, doctor, as soon as he recovers a little?”</p>

<p>“The sooner the better. I’m glad you’re going with
him. Keep him out in the open all day, and don’t let him
talk or think about his work. Let him play golf, and
keep him out of doors until he falls asleep directly he gets
into bed. No stimulants whatever. Has he been sleeping
badly lately, Mrs. Currey?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he told me he seldom got to sleep till late in the
morning.”</p>

<p>“Madness! Sheer madness to neglect such warnings.
Paton, I’ll have a talk with you before he goes. How
did you find him?”</p>

<p>“I got Carey Image to go the rounds of the hospitals
in case it was an accident, and I went myself to all the
police-stations. As a matter of fact, someone had just
recognized him as I arrived at Bow Street. As far as I
can make out, he took a stiff hot whiskey at the club
before leaving—he told the waiter he thought he had a
cold coming on—and went out into the night air. Owing
to the taxi strike there were no cabs about, and after
waiting a few minutes, Gilbert said he would walk.”</p>

<p>“And the fresh air on top of the hot whiskey finished
him,” commented Neeburg. “Was he very violent?”</p>

<p>“So the policeman said. He thought it was an ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
case of drunk and disorderly. He could hardly articulate,
and couldn’t say where he lived or his name. The policeman
says the more he tried to say it the more violent
he became, and, as it happens, there was nothing in his
pockets to identify him. He spent the night in an
ordinary lock-up. It wasn’t the fault of the police.”</p>

<p>“I hope this won’t get in the papers,” said Claudia
thoughtfully. “You know how Gilbert would feel that,
Colin; can you——?”</p>

<p>“I’ll try. I must go now. Ring up Pat and ask her
to come and be with you. Good-bye, Neeburg; I’ll ring
you up and fix an appointment....” He turned to
Claudia. “You were splendid when he came in. It
must have been rather a shock to you.”</p>

<p>“Splendid! Colin, don’t laugh at me. I’m the least
splendid of women. I ought not to accept that dedication.
Take it out. I’m not worth it. If—if I don’t
break all the sins in the Decalogue, it’s because—yes, I
suppose it’s because I’m a coward.”</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes miserably to his, and at what she
read in his some of the anguish and self-abasement in her
heart was softened. For a few moments they stood
silent, only their eyes speaking.</p>

<p>“Colin,” she whispered, her finger-tips playing with
his coat, “do you still believe in me—after—last night?”</p>

<p>“If you told me with your own lips that you <em>had</em> committed
all the sins in the Decalogue, I should not believe
you. I think I know you, Claudia, better than you know
yourself, and I believe in you more than you believe in
yourself.... I shall be back in the afternoon, in case
you want me.”</p>

<p>He was gone, but Claudia went upstairs with a load
taken off her heart. She did not try to analyse the meaning
of it, she only knew that the sting had been taken
out of her folly.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="smaller">AN AMIABLE STUFFED ANIMAL</span></h3>

<p>“I don’t understand it,” said Lady Currey, in tones
of extreme annoyance, “<em>my</em> husband never had a nervous
breakdown.”</p>

<p>She was lunching <i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> with Claudia at the flat,
for she and her husband had quartered themselves most
considerably upon her directly they had heard of Gilbert’s
illness. Lady Currey’s meaning was unmistakable.
In some way, she evidently held Claudia responsible.</p>

<p>Claudia played with her toast, but she made no reply.
Gilbert was better, and his memory had returned to him,
but he was again very irritable and rebellious. After the
two excitements had come the reaction, and she sat facing
the window, her face quite expressionless, weariness and
boredom in her eyes and on her lips. Her excursion into
the realm of romance was over. She did not regret her
decision, but now life seemed stale and unprofitable, like
the drab sea-shore when the turbulent waters have receded.
It seemed to her at the moment that she had
come to an end of all things. Life stretched in a grey
monotone before her. She was in a cage, and what release
could she hope for? Gilbert would go to Le Touquet
and get better, and things would continue on just the
same lines as before, only, unless her nature radically
changed, she could never experiment again with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
modern solace of the dissatisfied married woman. A
Rhoda Carnegie, a Circe might, but apparently for her
it was impossible. As Jack had said, she would always
see through the whole business.</p>

<p>She came out of her reverie to discover Lady Currey
looking at her questioningly with her shallow eyes.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” she said contritely.</p>

<p>“I asked you if you really gave attention to his having
good, nourishing food. I’ve always made a point of
having the best English meat and fresh vegetables.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it’s a question of diet,” replied Claudia,
with a faint smile, “and we can’t grow our vegetables on
the balcony. Dr. Neeburg says it is overwork. Your
husband once told me that hard work never yet hurt any
man.”</p>

<p>“Fancy his being locked up in a common police-cell!
I shall never get over that. My poor dear Gilbert! What
his feelings must have been when he recovered himself!
It seems to me the police were greatly to blame in exceeding
their duty, but my husband tells me we cannot take
action against them.... Do you give Gilbert porridge for
his breakfast? I strongly believe in porridge myself.”</p>

<p>“You might talk to Dr. Neeburg,” suggested her
daughter-in-law. Her only comfort was the great bowl
of narcissi in the centre of the table and Billie’s warm,
loving little body against her skirt. She was certain he
looked up every now and then with sympathy in his soft
eyes.</p>

<p>“I don’t approve of a German doctor, even though he
has been in England most of his life,” said Lady Currey
primly. “I know all about German doctors and their
cleverness, but is it the right kind of cleverness? I wish
Gilbert would see dear old Doctor Green. He treated him
as a baby. All German doctors are faddists. I daresay
Dr. Green could have averted this trouble. He’s wonderful
when I’ve got a sore throat, and his manner is so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
restful. He doesn’t approve of German doctors either.
He says they experiment on you. That’s exactly what I
think.... Don’t you think your laundry puts too much
starch in the serviettes? Starch ruins good linen. I see
there is a small hole already in the corner of this one.
No, no German doctors for me, thank you. I should
make ready to die if I fell in the hands of one.”</p>

<p>Claudia knew that she ought to be able to laugh—inwardly—but
somehow her sense of humour seemed to
have deserted her. One cannot support life entirely on a
sense of humour, though it helps one over many a dreary
mile. How Pat would have enjoyed the conversation,
thought Claudia.</p>

<p>“Does this German say how long Gilbert ought to
rest? It’s dreadful to think of his work being at a standstill.”</p>

<p>“Some months, but it depends, of course, on the
patient. He seems to have got another touch of influenza—I
suppose it was the cold of the cells, and he never
really got rid of it; but next Monday he will go to Le
Touquet.”</p>

<p>“I suppose Le Touquet is all right,” said Lady Currey,
in a dissatisfied tone. “I think French places are often
so enervating, and you can never be sure of the water in
France. I must tell Gilbert always to drink mineral
water. France is so dreadfully behind in the matter of
hygiene. Look at a Frenchwoman’s pasty complexion.”</p>

<p>“Le Touquet is above any kind of reproach,” Claudia
reassured her, hailing the arrival of coffee as one who,
lost in the bush, sees the first sign of a human habitation.
“The air is excellent, and Gilbert always enjoys the golf
there. He chose it himself out of several places. He
hates sea-voyages, you know, or Dr. Neeburg wished him
to go on one.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. He inherits my constitution in that
respect. Are these cups old Worcester? I have some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
very like them, but I do not care to have them used.
You know they are very valuable? Servants are so
careless. They broke a really exquisite piece of old
Chelsea the other day. I cried, I positively cried, and had
a headache all the rest of the day. I don’t know when I
have been so upset, except”—hastily—“of course, when
I heard the terrible news about poor Gilbert! I think
I’ll go up and see how he feels now, and ask him if he
won’t see Dr. Green.”</p>

<p>Later in the day Mr. Littleton came in to see Claudia.
He found her with Billie on her lap, a volume of Strindberg’s
plays in her hands. He took in at a glance her
tired, languid aspect, though she greeted him cordially
enough. There were but few people she wanted to see
that day, but Littleton was one of them.</p>

<p>“Madame,” he said with mock seriousness, “Strindberg
is not good reading for you to-day. Horribly clever, but
much too morbid. His plays are interesting to those
who study human nature, but they are not exhilarating.”</p>

<p>“Morbid! I don’t know. Because he presents men and
women as complex, many-sided, vari-coloured egos, you
call him morbid. Don’t talk like Jack.”</p>

<p>He smiled and picked up the book, and commenced to
read. “‘Our souls, so eager for knowledge, cannot rest
satisfied with seeing what happens, but must also learn
how it comes to happen. What we want to see are just
the wires, the machinery. We want to investigate the
box with the false bottom, touch the magic ring in order
to find the suture, and look into the cards to discover
how they are marked.’ You can carry that spirit too
far, you know. I guess you have too much time on your
hands. How is your husband?”</p>

<p>“Better. He goes to Le Touquet next week.”</p>

<p>“Le Touquet! Why, I’m going there for a few days;
partly because a French author I want to see is there,
and won’t leave his golf to write letters, and partly because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
I want a little holiday. How delightful! We shall
meet there, then.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I am not going.”</p>

<p>He was distinctly disappointed. “Is it permitted to
ask why not? It’s delicious weather now. Can’t you
smell the sea and the pines and the springy, sandy grass?”</p>

<p>She could, and a sudden desire to get away from London
caught hold of her. She would have to meet Frank
if she kept her engagements, and that would be awkward.
She was willing to be friends, to turn over the page, but
she divined that he was too angry. It would be awkward.</p>

<p>He saw the sudden light in her eyes, the quickening
of interest, and urged her afresh.</p>

<p>“We could make it international golf, you know,
England <i lang="la">versus</i> America. And between the holes we
could talk Strindberg if you liked. Not that you would
want to, with a fresh breeze blowing in your face, and
your club in your hand.” They both laughed. “No, I
can’t see Strindberg on a golf-course. Do come. Was
your husband going alone? Surely that is not good
for him?”</p>

<p>“Colin Paton is going with him.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Littleton did some quick thinking. He
had wondered once or twice if she were particularly interested
in Colin, but as she had not thought of accompanying
them, he deduced that the answer was in the
negative. “Then we should be a foursome on our own.
Have you anything very special to keep you in London?”</p>

<p>“No, except poor Fay, you know. She has got to look
forward to my going to her constantly.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Charles Littleton gently, “she is likely to
be ill for many, many months, is she not? Forgive me
for attempting to persuade you to anything, but you
know you are not looking quite your usual self. You
are not the woman I met at the Rivingtons. I don’t know
if it is fresh air you need, but fresh air always helps every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
trouble, don’t you think? One can always see everything
more clearly in the country. You are much too analytical
and introspective. Blow the mental cobwebs away at
Le Touquet.”</p>

<p>He felt practically sure she would come when he left,
and expectation leapt high at the thought of the days with
her. Her husband would be there, but he realized that
he had no rival in her husband. He did not dread burnt-out
fires, and Colin Paton would naturally pair with Gilbert.
He was not an imaginative man, he had never had
any time to dream, and he had always stifled any tender
shoots of romance; but he longed to have her there with
him, among the sweet-scented pines through which they
would walk, on the fine stretches of grass and sand, playing
the little white ball, by the sea-shore with its curling
waves and long, long stretches of level, golden sand. Romance
had come to him late in life, but now he did not
stifle it. He would stake his all on this throw; he would
make a fight for what he did not deserve to win. Perhaps
Fate would be kind to him, perhaps she would forgive his
early absorption in business, his blunt refusals of her invitations
to enjoy life. He had rejected the possibilities
of love before, now—now was there still a chance for
him? If Claudia could be won—ah! the tall, spare
American who walked along with alert, springy footsteps
was not thinking of dollars or glory, only of the beauty
of a woman’s heart and body which had swept him off his
feet. His whole soul was invaded by her presence. She
was his entire horizon.</p>

<p>So it happened that on Monday they all travelled together.
Colin had approved heartily of her going, and
as soon as she set foot on the Boulogne boat Claudia felt
a little uplift that brightened her face and made it possible
for her once again to take an interest in her fellow-creatures.
Colin and Littleton were both good companions,
and though Gilbert was rather morose—his humiliating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
experience had left a scar that would not heal—Claudia
was happier than she had been for a long time.</p>

<p>She knew that she was happier, and she wondered why.
Nothing was changed. Then she resolutely put questioning
on one side. “I won’t think about myself or my
stupid emotions,” she said vehemently to herself. “I’ll
just be a brainless animal for awhile, at least”—truthfully—“I’ll
try.”</p>

<p>She was saying this to herself when she noticed that
Colin was regarding her.</p>

<p>“Were your lips moving in silent prayer?” he said
jokingly, “or was it some great poem in glory of the sea?”</p>

<p>“Neither. I was taking myself to task. I was telling myself
not to be an idiot, or rather”—laughingly—“to be one.”</p>

<p>“It’s rather involved. Is there any key?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m the key. If you know me well——” She
stopped and coloured, for she remembered when he had
said he knew her better than she knew herself. She
turned her head away as she added hastily, “But anyway,
it’s not worth solving. Who was it that said you should
never try to understand women, you should be content
with loving them?”</p>

<p>“Someone who wanted to appear smart,” answered
Colin promptly.</p>

<p>“Do you think you understand women?”</p>

<p>“Heaven forfend! Is thy servant a grey-headed wizard
that he should lay claim to such knowledge? Wouldst
thou have me bear a burden beyond my years? Besides,
if I pretended that I did, you’d only slay me with great
despatch and neatness. Do look at that elderly woman
occupying four seats!”</p>

<p>“Well, look at the man who has just put his seat in the
middle of the gangway and looks daggers at everyone who
falls over his chair!... By the by, you know Patricia
has announced her determination of coming over to Le
Touquet for a few days next week.” She spoke carelessly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
but she watched the effect of her words upon him.
She could see no change, however. He only nodded
cheerily.</p>

<p>“We shall be quite a merry party, shan’t we? She
has announced her intention of turning ten complete
somersaults on the first green!”</p>

<p>“She’s a dear, isn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Of the first water.” But there was no undue enthusiasm
in his tone. “And she’s very devoted to you.”</p>

<p>“Is she? I don’t deserve it.”</p>

<p>“Not in the least. I have been trying to talk her out
of it. Quite unsuccessfully, I may add.”</p>

<p>It was really very provoking. He would not be drawn.
Did he deliberately refuse her his confidence? Were he
and Pat keeping a secret?</p>

<p>She tried again.</p>

<p>“I suppose she’ll be getting married one of these days.”</p>

<p>“Well,” he said thoughtfully, “it is a fate that frequently
overtakes charming women. The lady with the
four seats has been obliged to relinquish one of her seats
to another elderly female with a bird-cage. It takes an
elderly lady to outwit another elderly lady.”</p>

<p>“Pat don’t believe in marriage.”</p>

<p>“We none of us <em>believe</em> in marriage. It’s a question
of faith and hope, like religion. It isn’t an Athanasian
Creed, with vehement damnatory clauses, which have no
application to yourself.”</p>

<p>“You can’t talk, you haven’t tried it,” retorted Claudia.
“Then you think—someone—will convert Pat to the usual
fate? You already see her in white satin and orange-blossom,
and a noisy voice from Eden breathing hard
over her?” The wind was causing her hair to wave
wildly, and whipping her cheeks to a brilliant pink. Some
of the sparkle had come back in her eyes at the contest,
and the man at her side was more than aware of her good
looks. “Two of us have already made disastrous marriages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
Heigh ho! for a third! I’m sure there’s no luck
of the children of Circe!”</p>

<p>She had never said plainly before to him that her
marriage was a failure. Always they had played about
the borderland of truth, each knowing that the other
knew. To-day for some reason, she had spoken plainly.</p>

<p>He was silent, leaning against the gunwale, looking
down at the hurrying, foaming waters below.</p>

<p>“Are you shocked at me for my lack of reticence?”
she said rather bitterly. “Yes, you can’t joke about that.
I wanted to make you serious. Oh, yes! you <em>can</em> make
a joke now. Look, your old lady is not feeling well, and
is hurriedly relinquishing the three seats. Why don’t
you look? It’s quite funny, and you always take life
with a smile.”</p>

<p>But he never lifted his eyes from the foaming, greenish
water. Only his hand, which gripped the gunwale tightly,
showed any sign of emotion.</p>

<p>“Don’t.... Perhaps when Gilbert is better——”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! it’s quite hopeless. You can’t make a new
fire with white ashes. Did you ever think we were suited
to one another?” She was gazing out at sea. Every now
and then a lurch of the boat sent her arm against his,
and once a strand of her hair swept his cheek.</p>

<p>He was a little time before he replied. “Claudia, you
once said something like that before. You said I might
have warned you. Was that fair? It hurt me. Suppose
I had said to you, ‘I don’t think Gilbert can make you
happy.’ What would you have thought of me? Think
how happy and confident you were. And—can anyone
interfere in such matters? Are they not questions we
<em>must</em> decide for ourselves? I—or anyone—would always
be utterly helpless, whatever you chose to do.”</p>

<p>She gave a sigh. “I know. I shouldn’t have believed
you.”</p>

<p>The next words seemed to slip out almost against his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
will. “And you might have thought I was jealous of
my friend.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” she exclaimed impulsively. “I should
never have thought that.”</p>

<p>“I see,” he replied, with a bitterness she had never
before heard in his voice. “I was never a real man to
you. I was and am only a literary abstraction, an amiable
stuffed animal, suitable for friendship, a——”</p>

<p>She lifted startled, amazed eyes to his, but at that
instant Littleton’s voice sounded the other side of her.</p>

<p>“I need not ask you if you enjoy the sea, Mrs. Currey?
Isn’t it bully? I like it rough, don’t you?”</p>

<p>Just then the spray caught them all, and for the next
few minutes they were busy laughingly mopping their
faces and coats.</p>

<p>“I call that a playful smack in the eye for my patronizing
tone,” said Littleton. “I believe Nature hates us
most when we patronize her. She did us all in then. Say,
Mrs. Currey, will your husband be able to do much
golfing?”</p>

<p>She looked inquiringly at Colin, for Neeburg had given
him the final instructions.</p>

<p>“In moderation, Mr. Littleton. He mustn’t get over-tired—Neeburg
was very insistent on that—but a certain
amount of golf and exercise will keep him from brooding,
and make him healthily tired.”</p>

<p>Littleton nodded. “I once had a bad attack of nerves.
My! but I shall never forget it. I got so that I stuttered
in my speech, and I used to fancy people were watching
me. I couldn’t sleep and had all sorts of weird fancies.
I could hear the telephone-bell ringing all night, and when
I did get to sleep, I used to jump up with a shout to
answer it. They sent me for a long sea-voyage to Australia.
I came back cured. But it was an awful time.
One ought to be sympathetic with a man in that condition.
Only one who has been through really understands.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>After a few minutes Claudia left the two men and
walked over to where Gilbert was seated in a chair, reading
the <cite>Times</cite>. He did not suffer from <i lang="fr">mal de mer</i>, but
he always experienced a curious feeling in his head, as
though someone had put a band round his forehead.</p>

<p>“Gilbert, why don’t you enjoy the air and the sea?”
she said gently. “Why do you worry your brain with
the paper?” She noticed he was reading the law news.</p>

<p>He did not look up at her, but finished reading a case
before he replied. “I knew the view Morely would take
of the affair. I told Roche so at the beginning. He’s
the most bigoted old fool on the bench. What did you
say? Well, the sea bores me. It’s just—sea!”</p>

<p>“Talk to me. The trip is very short.”</p>

<p>With evident reluctance he put down the paper.</p>

<p>“Gilbert,” she said earnestly, “do give yourself every
chance. Can’t you pretend to yourself that this a well-earned
holiday, and that you are going to enjoy it thoroughly?
Put London and the Law Courts out of your
mind.”</p>

<p>He gave a half-sigh, half-grunt. “That’s like a woman.
Women think you can detach yourself from your real
interest in life, like you can take off an old overcoat. I
must think of something. Claudia, how many papers did
my—my accident get into?”</p>

<p>“Only one or two unimportant ones. You needn’t
worry about that, Gilbert.”</p>

<p>He frowned at the blue sky overhead. “I suppose
everybody was laughing about it.... It was that hot
whisky that did it.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Don’t think about it.”</p>

<p>“A few weeks will set me up. I suppose I really did
need a holiday. But I never thought I should have to
give up like this. You’ve got the laugh on me, Claudia.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to laugh, Gilbert. I realize what this
means to you and—I’m sorry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked at her with his sombre, heavy-lidded eyes,
that had once darkened with overmastering passion,
that night of the dance. All the youthfulness had gone
out of the face. He might have been a man of forty-five
instead of thirty-five. Youth had fought unsuccessfully
with a heaviness of the spirit that had always been there,
but had greatly increased the last two years. She wondered
of what he was thinking as he looked at her. One
could never guess with Gilbert. He had the typical
barrister’s face, non-committal, secretive of his thoughts.</p>

<p>Then he said abruptly, “Enjoy yourself at Le Touquet.
I shan’t. It’s medicine, and I must take it. Just leave
me alone and have a good time yourself. Is that Boulogne?
Thank goodness!”</p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br />
<span class="smaller">BACK TO “THE GAME”</span></h3>

<p>Gilbert did not prove an easy patient to manage,
because though he was still in need of treatment,
being well had become a habit. He was impatient of any
restraint, and sometimes almost rude to Colin, who took
the chief share of the restraining. Neeburg had limited
him to nine holes, morning and afternoon, which meant
that a good portion of his day was unoccupied.</p>

<p>And that which Claudia had foreseen came to pass. He
had no hobby to amuse him. He hated to be alone with
his own thoughts, and yet he was either impatient with
other people’s conversation and ideas, or he was bored
with the subjects that interested them, and did not interest
him. He did not sleep well, and he had taken a dislike to
books. Bridge and billiards he had always considered a
waste of time, and the entertainments at the small Casino
did not amuse him. He took no interest in the small
happenings of life, which for other people pleasantly
diversify the days with their light and shade. His day
was one long fidget to get back into harness.</p>

<p>Still, the bracing air did him good, and his nerves daily
got steadier. Sometimes he almost looked his old self.</p>

<p>One day, after they had been there for a week, it
happened to be very wet, and golf for Gilbert was out of
the question. He and Colin were sitting out on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
verandah of the Golf Hotel, smoking and talking, when
Claudia came out to them. She seated herself a little
distance away, with <cite lang="fr">Le Petit Journal</cite>, which she looked at
in a desultory holiday sort of way, as they went on
talking. Gilbert was evidently replying to some remark
of Colin’s.</p>

<p>“It’s what you call ‘tolerance’ that is ruining England.
It’s a blessing for her that there are a few ‘intolerant’
people left. You know, Colin, you’ve got mixed up with
a lot of cranks, all grinding their own little axes. For
instance, I can’t think why you want to mess about with
such questions as Child Labour. It won’t make you
popular, very few people take an interest in it. Why
don’t you leave such questions to faddists? I wonder
that a man of your ability plays about with such small
issues.”</p>

<p>Claudia saw a fighting gleam in Colin’s eye, but he
replied quietly enough.</p>

<p>“We always did disagree on our definition of ‘small,’
you know, Gilbert. A small question does not become a
big one because it becomes the popular one of the day.”</p>

<p>Gilbert made a gesture of impatience. “Nonsense, you
must accept the world’s verdict on these things, and let
me tell you, as a lawyer, that the verdict of the people
is pretty sound, in spite of any Ibsen paradoxes you may
fling at me. If you like to paddle about in a backwater,
no one can prevent you, but don’t pretend it’s the main
stream, or rather don’t expect anyone to believe you. I
think enough has been talked about Child Labour. Sentimental
twaddle! The law has done all that is necessary.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever gone closely into the question, Gilbert?”
Colin took his cigarette-case out of his pocket and
abstracted another cigarette.</p>

<p>“Yes, as much as I want to. I once had a compensation
case, where a lot of sentiment was dragged in by
the heels.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah! you represented the employer, of course?” He
threw the match over the verandah.</p>

<p>“Well? The parents of the child were willing it should
work. The sentiment came in when it got injured.”</p>

<p>“Exactly, that’s just what we complain of. Child
labour demoralizes the parents. But, leaving the parents
out of the question,” his voice grew warmer, in spite of
his evident effort to keep cool—“don’t you see that the
interest of future generations of workers demands that
children, instead of becoming ‘half-timers,’ shall have a
chance to develop, to let their bodies grow into something
strong and fine, so that—and this should appeal to <em>you</em>—England
may hold her own against other younger, more
vigorous nations. I say nothing about the joyless lives
of the children who are old in mind as well as body before
those of our class go to Eton or Harrow, but surely the
future of the race interests you? You get more work out
of a vigorous, able-bodied man or woman.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes! I’m interested, but I prefer to work for the
present generation. I’ll do without a rain-washed, dirty
statue that a crank occasionally puts a wreath on and
no one else remembers.”</p>

<p>“Gilbert!” exclaimed Claudia, unable to let the taunt
pass. “How can you be such an arrant materialist?”</p>

<p>“We live in a materialistic age, my dear,” said her
husband coolly. “In a few years’ time ideals will be as
dead as door-nails. Idealists are usually weak dreamers,
who resent the driving force of others, and who try—ineffectually—to
dam the current of their progress. I don’t
mean that you are to be classed with these ineffectuals,
Colin, but you allow yourself to be carried away by their
enthusiasms. Enthusiasm is a good servant, but a bad
master. To do anything worth doing, you must have a
judicial mind, and put nothing of yourself in the scale.”</p>

<p>“All the great reformers of the world have been enthusiasts,”
cried Claudia impetuously. “The dry-as-dust,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
cold-blooded men and women have never achieved anything.
I say, thank God for the enthusiasts of the world,
who are not dismayed by columns of statistics!”</p>

<p>Her eyes and Colin’s met, and his thanked her silently,
but a little shake of the head told her not to trouble to
argue, that it was only beating her head against a brick
wall.</p>

<p>“My dear Claudia, you are a woman and belong to the
emotional, impressionable sex. But, for Heaven’s sake,
don’t you join any of these crank movements,” he went
on impatiently—“for if I am going into Parliament, I
don’t want to be saddled with my wife’s partisanships.
It’s quite enough to fight the cranks in the House, I don’t
want any on my own hearthrug.”</p>

<p>She was tempted to make a hot retort, but Colin’s look
checked her. After all, it <em>was</em> useless, and she had determined
not to quarrel with him.</p>

<p>“I shan’t be able to stick this much longer,” grumbled
her husband, getting up and inspecting the leaden skies.
“Rotten weather!”</p>

<p>“It’s the first bad day we’ve had, old man,” replied
his friend cheerfully.</p>

<p>“And no newspapers yet.... I wasn’t cut out for a
life of idleness. I’ll go in and write some letters.”</p>

<p>He got up and left them on the verandah, and Claudia
gave up the pretense of reading.</p>

<p>“Colin,” she exclaimed vehemently, “how came you
and he to be friends when you are so different? His
views are too awful.”</p>

<p>“There are a lot of people who think as he does,” returned
Colin thoughtfully. “But it was sweet of you
to take up the cudgels on my behalf. Those things are
not easy to do in front of—a Gilbert.”</p>

<p>She flushed a little. “I just had to say it. I was so
entirely with you. I always am. And yet, he is my
husband.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>“<em>You</em> don’t think me weak and ineffectual?” He looked
out over the rain-bleared golf-course, at the dark row
of pines in the distance. “You used to lay so much stress
on strength, on achievement. You quite frightened me.”</p>

<p>“Don’t!” she said quickly. “Sometimes one may mistake
hardness for strength. Don’t”—pitifully—“don’t
rub it in, Colin.” Her eyes suddenly filled with
tears.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear!”—the caress seemed to slip out involuntarily—“I
didn’t mean to do that.... And though I
wanted you to say I wasn’t, I <em>am</em> weak—pitifully weak....
I want a woman’s good opinion, a woman’s approval.
I want someone to believe in me, to urge me on ...
that’s weak, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Only according to Gilbert’s creed,” she said softly.
“You and I have a different one.”</p>

<p>He got up and paced the verandah.</p>

<p>“It would be happier for you if you could adopt his
creed—and you’re very young. You want happiness?”</p>

<p>“Badly.”</p>

<p>“I wish—I could see you happy. The Bible says, ‘the
prayer of the righteous man availeth much,’ but I can’t
pray.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you are any happier—although you
seem so cheerful—than I am.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>The rain softly murmured around them. They were
the only occupants of the verandah.</p>

<p>“We’re not very lucky, are we?...” She turned
abruptly to him, her hands gripping the edge of the
verandah, her eyes bright with a curious wildness. “Colin,
I’m sometimes so frightened of the future. I’m twenty-four
now. Shall I always go on being unhappy and dissatisfied
until I become a nasty, bitter, lonely old woman,
jealous of every happy couple I meet, envious of everyone
else’s happiness? It’s a horrid picture, isn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>He did not say a word, but he watched her profile as
she looked out at the rain.</p>

<p>“Gilbert will grow more and more like his father, and
he will become the right honorable member for Langton.
He may rise to be Attorney-General. Perhaps he’ll get
a seat in the Cabinet. I shall open Primrose League
bazaars and be chilly to the wives of Labour members
when I meet them. I shall go to innumerable long, stupid
dinners and try and remember to be gracious to the right
persons. I shall become the possessor of some wonderful
china and perhaps flit about with a duster in a silk bag.
And my heart—well”—with a sudden gust of passion that
left her face deathly white—“I hope it will be atrophied
by that time.”</p>

<p>They had neither of them noticed the approach of a
motor, so that they were both startled to hear an English
shout from the bottom of the steps.</p>

<p>“Hallo! Isn’t the water cold?”</p>

<p>It was Pat, neat and workmanlike in her blue serge, a
small hat rammed down over her yellow hair. She
grinned up at their surprise.</p>

<p>“Pat! We didn’t expect you until to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I know, but I suddenly got fed up with London. I
hope I haven’t put the town band out by coming so soon,
but I just had to come.”</p>

<p>She came striding up the steps and gave Claudia a hug.</p>

<p>“Bless you, my children. Paton, I shall be in tremendous
form to-morrow. I feel it coming on. Directly
I got on the boat I wanted to drive off from the head of
the gangway, only it would be sure to have been a lost
ball.... I lost five last week. I think they were winged
angels masquerading as golf-balls. How’s Gilbert? Billie
sends his forlorn love. He’s as mournful as a Chinese
idol. Do you know where I’m supposed to hang myself
up?”</p>

<p>Claudia, who had arranged for her room on the morrow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
went ahead into the hotel, Colin and Pat following
after. She could not help hearing a hasty whisper of,
“Paton, I’ve got lots of things to tell you. Just <em>had</em> to
see you. Everything is going to be all right, and I’m
so happy.”</p>

<p>So her suspicions were correct. Colin and Pat were in
love with one another. Pat “just had to see him.” What
was that but love? Only love can drive with such impatience.</p>

<p>“I hope it’s a pretty long bed,” she could hear Pat
chattering. “I went to stay at an hotel once, and we took
it in turns to rest, my top half and my lower half. I’d
like to sleep all at once, if possible.”</p>

<p>Colin laughed. He was always on very cheery terms
with Patricia, and she with him. It was she, Claudia
remembered, who had once so highly extolled Paton as a
possible husband. At that time she had not appeared
to have any <i lang="fr">penchant</i> for him. But sometimes the knowledge
of her love comes suddenly to a young girl. Perhaps
it had come suddenly to Pat. And she would make
him a very nice wife. She was loyal to the core, and she
would believe in him. She would fight for him, if necessary,
through thick and thin, the bigger the fight the
more she would like it. She would never quite understand
one side of him, perhaps, but maybe her steady
cheeriness was what he needed. How often she had
heard it said that like should not seek like in marriage.
She remembered someone had said, “In love they who
resemble, separate.” Pat was lucky, and if she felt a
little twinge of jealousy—well, it was the first symptoms
of the soured old woman period she had been envisaging.
She would presently look on all young couples in the same
way.</p>

<p>“So your sister has arrived,” she heard Mr. Littleton
say, as she stood musing in the hall. “She hasn’t brought
good weather with her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>“No,” returned Claudia mechanically, “but Pat doesn’t
mind the weather.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess that befits an Amazon. She’s a splendid
specimen of English womanhood.”</p>

<p>Her sister nodded. Yes, she was; no wonder Colin
admired her.</p>

<p>“A little too splendid for my taste,” smiled Littleton.
“Who was it laid down the law that a woman should be
just as high as the shoulder of the man she loves?” He
looked at the dark, glossy head just on the level of his
own shoulder, but she did not notice it. She was trying
to adjust her ideas: “I reckon he was a cosy man, who
ever he was.”</p>

<p>He wondered what had caused that curiously blank
look on her face, a sort of half stunned surprise.</p>

<p>Just then Pat and Colin came laughing into the hall,
she having, with her characteristic quickness, found and
donned a tweed rain-proof coat.</p>

<p>“Claud, we’re going for a tramp. Come with us?
It’s no good minding the wet. You look as if you’ve been
in all day.”</p>

<p>Her sister pulled herself together and replied lightly,
“I’m sure, from your tone, it’s an unbecoming look, but
I refuse to let the rain wash it off. I hate walking in
the rain.”</p>

<p>“It’s nearly left off,” said Paton, glancing out of the
door, “the clouds are breaking.”</p>

<p>“I tell you I don’t want to go.... Run away, young
people!”</p>

<p>Littleton noticed the edge to her tone, noticed it because
he loved her and, by now, had grown sensitive to
its many inflections. Because he loved her, he tried to
understand her, to respond to her moods, to fall in with
her humours. He adored her quick changes, sometimes
half a dozen in the space of ten minutes; the melodies
in her voice, sometimes tender, sometimes firm, occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
gay and still girlish. He was willing to do anything
to make her happy, and he had seen very clearly the rift
in the lute, the rift that had been inevitable. Could he
hope to win her love? She had given him nothing that
could be considered encouragement, although she was
always friendly and ready to talk to him. She no longer
loved her husband, and it was not possible that such a
woman could exist for long without some man in her
life. Why not——</p>

<p>Then he saw the expression on her face. She had forgotten
he was standing there. She was absorbed in her
thoughts, but her eyes were fixed on the couple going
down the path. Pat was talking eagerly, and she had
just slipped her hand confidentially within Colin’s arm to
emphasize some point.</p>

<p>Love gives even the most stupid of men extraordinary
powers of intuition where the woman he loves is concerned.
In a flash he knew that his own suit was hopeless
and the reason.</p>

<p>His fair skin had grown very grey as he spoke to her,
and the light in his eyes was suddenly quenched.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Currey, this is my last day here, you know. Too
bad it’s wet, isn’t it? We might have gone over the
links once again together.”</p>

<p>The words effectually roused her. “Your last day
here? I thought you were going to stay on a few more
days? Oh, I’m sorry! But we shall meet when I come
back to town, <i lang="fr">n’est-ce pas</i>?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” he said regretfully. “I—I shall probably
be sailing for New York next week. The firm has
been calling for me for some time. ‘Home, sweet Home,’
you know, and the American eagle!”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s too bad.” Her tone was unaffectedly
regretful and sincere. Perhaps, later on, he would feel
it a slight consolation that he had won through to her
friendship, but at present it was caustic on the wound.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
“I shall miss you. I suppose it’s ‘the game’ once more?
We women are hopelessly out of it!”</p>

<p>He shook his head. “There is only ‘the game’ left to
me, and now—it doesn’t interest me very much. Life
has a queer way of giving you backhanders occasionally,
hasn’t it? Mrs. Currey, you’ve taught me there are finer
things, more worth striving for, than mere commercial
gain. Oh, it will fill up the time quite nicely, and I shall
still get some thrills out of doing the other fellow.” They
had wandered out on the verandah again. “See here,
I don’t know how a woman takes these things. I don’t
know whether she likes a man to tell her he loves her,
or would rather he went away with his tongue held between
his teeth. But I feel I should like to tell you that
I love you.... I would have done anything to win
and keep your love, if there had been any hope for me....
At one time I had a crazy dream you might, perhaps,
trust yourself to me and make another start with me on
the other side. I know you’re brave enough to make a
fight for your happiness, and not begrudge paying a price
for it. You’re not the kind of woman to be frightened
by a few law-court bogys.... No, you need not look
so sorry. It’s my own fault. I walked clean into it. I
guess I gave the best years of my life to the rottenest
game out. Well, that game’s all that is left me. I’ve got
to go on playing, whether I want to or not.”</p>

<p>“But I <em>am</em> sorry.... I like you so much. I almost
wish—— But I think something has happened to my
heart.... I can’t feel it. I feel sort of numbed. I
don’t even seem to believe in love any longer. I wish I
could fall in love. I think it would put some life in me.
I used to laugh at a woman who said when she wasn’t
in love she was only half alive. But there’s something
in it. Degrading admission, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>He looked at her with a curious expression—half wonderment,
half tenderness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then you don’t know!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Know what?” The figures of Colin and Pat were
rapidly becoming miniatures in the distance.</p>

<p>“Never mind. Only when you <em>do</em> know—remember
how we stood here—and that I knew.”</p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI<br />
<span class="smaller">THE MEANING OF LIFE</span></h3>

<p>The boy threaded his way among the tables, until he
came to where the Currey party sat.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Madame, s’il vous plaît, on vous demande au téléphone
de l’Angleterre.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Moi?</i>” ejaculated Claudia, in surprise.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Mais oui, Madame.</i>”</p>

<p>Claudia rose and hurried to the telephone, hardly having
time to wonder who it could be. Then she heard
Jack’s voice on the other end.</p>

<p>“Claudia, is that you? Oh, for God’s sake, old girl,
come back. I have blurted out the truth to Fay. She
cornered me, and I confessed to her there wasn’t any
chance.... It’s dreadful ... she wants you ... we can’t
do anything with her. If you don’t come, I shall
blow my brains out. I can’t stand it. Pat’s there, isn’t
she? You can come, can’t you?”</p>

<p>Claudia thought rapidly. “Yes, I’ll come, Jack. By
to-night’s boat. All right, you meet me at Charing Cross.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>She heard a sort of sob of relief from the other end,
and he commenced to blab broken words of gratitude, but
she cut him short. “No good talking on the telephone,
old boy. It was rather cruel of you ... you shouldn’t
have let her corner you. Tell her I’m coming.”</p>

<p>She went back to the luncheon-table, but her appetite
for lunch was gone.</p>

<p>She was half afraid Gilbert would make some objection
to her going, but except by a shrug of his shoulders and
the raising of his thick eyebrows, he put no obstacles in
her way.</p>

<p>“Oh! poor little kid!” ejaculated Pat, her high spirits
momentarily sobered. “Fancy knowing that there is no
hope. Ugh! it must be like those torture-chambers of
old, when the victims watched the walls gradually close
in on them. I hope I shall die quickly and suddenly
when my time comes.”</p>

<p>“And yet there must be thousands at this very minute,
as we sit here, who are knowingly being enclosed by
those walls. I suppose we humans, on the whole, are a
poor lot, and yet sometimes I am struck with amazement
at the courage of men and women,” said Colin thoughtfully.
“When I pass through the crowded suburbs, I
marvel at the amount of quiet, unnoticed heroism those
brick walls must contain. But Fay—You have a difficult
task before you, Claudia. You can’t travel alone.
I will take you back to London.”</p>

<p>Claudia was longing to accept the offer, but she shook
her head. “Oh, no! thank you, Colin. You needn’t coddle
me. Pat came over alone.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but she came in the day-time, and you are travelling
at night. Can’t be done, madam. Pat will look
after our patient.”</p>

<p>“I wish you wouldn’t fuss over me,” said Gilbert testily.
“Of course I am glad of your company, but I don’t need
any kind of looking after. I’m not a hysterical, nervy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
woman. A man who is taking a rest isn’t a patient of
anyone’s.”</p>

<p>“Gilbert, don’t be grumpy,” said Pat, who was never
in the least overawed by Gilbert. “All men want looking
after. If you are rude, I shall follow you round the links
with a tin of Brand’s Essence and a spoon.”</p>

<p>Colin’s presence on the journey was a great comfort,
for he was quietly thoughtful without being fussy, and
she did not feel under any necessity to talk to him, unless
she had something to say. But she was pleasantly conscious
of his sympathy with her miserable errand. He
took her to the door of the flat and left her.</p>

<p>Claudia was startled when she saw her brother. She
had never believed it possible that anyone could go to
pieces so badly in such a short time. His young, unlined
face was haggard, his eyes were sunken and dull.</p>

<p>“Claudia, if you hadn’t come, I should have put an end to
myself. I can’t stand seeing her suffer so. I wish I hadn’t
told her, but she’s too cute for me. She always was.”</p>

<p>“How did you come to blurt it out?”</p>

<p>“Why, we were sitting quietly together, and I was
teaching her double-dummy, when she said, ‘Jack, isn’t
it too bad, I shall never get better?’—quite quietly—just
like I say it, and of course I—well, I gave the show away.
She’d been suspicious for a long time, it seems. She remembers
the case of a man in her profession that got hurt
in the same way years ago. She knows how miserably
he died a year afterwards.... She’d never said anything
about it before. Must have been thinking it out.
She raved it all out at me.” He shivered. “I shall never
get over this, Claudia.”</p>

<p>She was silent, as she took off her gloves.</p>

<p>“She cries and cries, and then suddenly she screams
in abject fright.... I keep on hearing those screams. I
can’t sleep for them. Oh, God! it’s too awful.”</p>

<p>The nurse had quietly entered. “I’m so glad you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
come, Mrs. Currey. You always had such an influence
over her. Will you come in? She’s been listening for
your arrival.”</p>

<p>It was something resembling a very young child that
threw itself with cries and sobs into her arms, when she
went to the bedside. Claudia knelt down and held her
tightly and silently to her breast. What words could she
use to the poor, frightened soul, that did not sound puerile
and meaningless? Even if she had herself believed in
the orthodox Heaven, Fay was too fond of this world to
have found any comfort in the visionary prospect. If
only the curtain had killed her outright on that fatal
night! That moment of surprise would have been her
only pang, and now——</p>

<p>“I don’t want to die,” sobbed Fay. “I’m young. I’m
only twenty-two. It’s wicked, it’s wicked.... I won’t
be resigned. Nurse says I ought to be. But she isn’t
going to die.”</p>

<p>“Fay, dear, I know it’s terribly hard.... I shan’t ask
you to be resigned. But will you listen to me for a few
minutes?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will—if you don’t want me to be resigned.
Young people can’t be resigned, can they?”</p>

<p>“No, but they can fight. Fay, have I ever told you
how much I admire you for the way you’ve risen in your
profession?” The sobbing grew quieter. “I’ve never
had to do anything for my living, and I don’t suppose I
can imagine one tenth part of the difficulty with which
people do earn their living—the competition, the horrid
spectres which people of my class never see, the fear of
breaking down, of not having enough at the end of the
week to pay the rent, to find food and clothing. You
were earning a splendid salary when—the accident happened,
but you didn’t always, did you?”</p>

<p>“Not much. The first few years after mother died I
had precious little, an engagement here and there, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
good many times I didn’t know where the tin was coming
from to pay the landlady.”</p>

<p>“I know. I guessed all that, because very few people
‘arrive’ without making a big fight. I’m sure you made
a splendid fight. You hung on to the managers and
agents till they gave you engagements, and you set your
teeth together and said to yourself, ‘I won’t be done,’
didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but how did you know?” She lifted the distorted,
tear-stained face wonderingly.</p>

<p>“You were quite a child when you made that fight, at
an age when I was still in the schoolroom. And you
fought fairly, and made lots of friends. Look at the
crowds of letters you get, asking how you are. Fay, go
on fighting. Don’t give in now.”</p>

<p>There was complete silence. The dark head was motionless.
Claudia knew she was taking in the idea, for
whenever Fay wanted to reason with herself, she always
thought in silence. She always took a special interval
from life to do her thinking.</p>

<p>“But what am I to fight for?” she said at length.</p>

<p>“To keep your own respect and the respect and admiration
of all who know you. Poor Jack loves you very
much in his way, and he is distracted. Help to steady
him, Fay. He is beginning to look at life more seriously.
He admires you immensely as an artist, make him
admire you as a <em>woman</em>. You told me once that you
didn’t want to do him any harm by marrying him. You
can do him a great deal of good.”</p>

<p>“Poor old Jumbo! I scared him out of his life.” She
gave a ghost of her gay smile. “I knew I’d get it out of
him. No one else would tell me.”</p>

<p>“He’s known all the time,” went on Claudia, stroking
her hair, as she would have a child’s. “It’s been a terrible
burden, Fay. You can see from his face how he
has been brooding over it. Jack’s never had to bear any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
kind of trouble in his life before. The world has been
all rose-leaves for him. I think he’s been putting up a
bit of a fight, too, because he hates trouble and illness,
and all the uncomfortable things of life. He’s come pretty
regularly to see you, hasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he has. I see what you’re driving at. But why
should I have to die? I swear to God I never did no one
no harm that I know of. There was a chap once I was
awful fond of, and him of me. We used to keep on meeting
on the Stoll tour. One week his wife came along.
She was a silly, soppy piece of goods; he liked a bit of a
devil, like me, but she was dead stuck on him, and there
was a baby coming. I sent him back to her, straight, I
did. I wouldn’t have no truck with him. He sent me
an awful nice letter when I got hurt. He’ll be sorry
when—when he hears.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure he will.”</p>

<p>Fay was silent again, her blue eyes fixed on an absurd
Teddy Bear on the chest of drawers. Then she said with
a queer jumble of ideas that left Claudia speechless:</p>

<p>“I shan’t be able to do that American tour next year,
and I shall never have a baby. Some people think kids
are a nuisance, but I’d like to have had one. Babies are
awful cute, aren’t they? Mabel Floyd’s got a kid of
four years old, and she does all her mother’s songs. Makes
you die with laughing. You should see her do the Bond
Street strut, with her mother’s monocle. She’ll make a
hit on the halls one of these days. Got it in her, you know,
same as I had.” She looked at a framed photograph
which hung on one of the walls. “Mother died when
she was thirty-two, but that was because she got soaking
wet one night, going to the theatre. But she didn’t mind
dying much. I remember that. She was dead tired, you
know. My father took his hook when I was four years
old, and he had knocked all the life out of her. I can
remember her saying, ‘If it wasn’t for you, I’d be glad to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
take a rest, Fay.’ But I don’t feel like that. I never
allowed any man to make my life a misery. If there was
any misery going about, the men got it. I wasn’t taking
any. Take my tip, my dear, don’t you let ’em squeeze
everything out of you. Mother taught me that lesson.
She had a thin time, poor thing.” Suddenly she commenced
to cry again, but gently. “I’ve heard people say
that those that are dead can look down on us. Do you
think mother can see me now?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, Fay. We know very little about the spiritual
world.”</p>

<p>After a minute Fay took her head off Claudia’s shoulder,
and pushed her away a little with one of her small,
babyish hands. Her blue eyes, still wet, searched her face
with such acuteness that Claudia was glad she had nothing
to hide any longer.</p>

<p>“Claudia, did you think all this out—about the fighting—as
you came to see me? Did you make it all up?”</p>

<p>Claudia shook her head, and her eyes were dark with
her own thoughts as she replied:</p>

<p>“No, Fay. It wasn’t thought out at all. I’ll tell you
the truth. I hadn’t the least idea what I could say to
you. I kept on asking myself, ‘What shall I say? What
shall I say?’ Then suddenly, as I came into your room
and saw you crying among the pillows, I knew what life
must mean for you, for me, for Jack, for everybody. A
sudden light seemed to come to me. An answer came to
some questions I have lately been putting to myself. I
realized that it doesn’t matter whether you win or lose,
whether you are happy or unhappy, as long as you keep
on fighting. I don’t understand life any more than you
do, dear. Sometimes it seems a pretty dreary business.
I’m hopelessly at sea. But—I see now—one must go on
swimming. You mustn’t just let your arms fall to your
side and sink. Perhaps, if you keep on swimming, a boat
may pick you up, or you may find an unsuspected island,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
and even if you don’t get rescued, I think one must die—swimming.”</p>

<p>Fay’s eyes opened widely, and her arms stole again
round her sister-in-law’s neck.</p>

<p>“How sad your voice sounds,” she whispered. “Are
you having a bad time? Aren’t you happy, either?”</p>

<p>Her sister-in-law’s voice was a little unsteady as she
said, in a low voice, “Fay, shall I tell you a secret? Can
you keep one?”</p>

<p>“Honour bright. May I be——”</p>

<p>“Listen, then.... No, I’m not happy.... I haven’t
found anything that I wanted in life. It’s all makeshifts.
I’m very restless, very dissatisfied, and just at the moment
I don’t find life worth living. Only yesterday I was talking
like a beastly coward. I was telling a friend that I
was frightened of the future, that I could see only blank,
empty, joyless days, and that I was going to develop into
a nasty, soured, cold-hearted woman. Now I see how
disgusting it was of me to say things like that, especially
when I was making him unhappy too. I know I ought
to brace up my muscles, and start swimming—like you.
I don’t feel like it, any more than you do.... You’ll
keep my secret, won’t you, Fay, and when I get tired, I’ll
come to you and do a howl, and when you get tired you
shall do the howling. And then we’ll make another effort
and go on swimming again. We’ll help one another, won’t
we? Somehow, I fancy the strong people of this world
are not those who always achieve great things, but those
who keep on fighting, who will not be downed by circumstances.”</p>

<p>Fay kissed her passionately. “I love you. I’d do anything
for you. And if I can help you—I didn’t know you
had any troubles—I should be so proud of myself. I’ve
always looked upon you as someone who didn’t want any
help, who always found it easy to do”—vaguely—“the
right thing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>“No! No!” cried Claudia, thinking of the humiliating
scene in the studio, “I don’t find it easy at all. I find
everything horribly difficult and confusing.... I haven’t
even got any fixed principles now. I hardly know what
I believe or disbelieve. Sometimes I think I am only
an artist, a pagan, merely craving for the beautiful, the
perfect; sometimes I feel there is more in life and love
than that ... there must be, there must be ... the whole
fabric of life could not have been built upon such an
insecure foundation. Passion is a big factor in life,
but there must be a bigger.”</p>

<p>She was talking to herself now, talking out her own
doubts, but Fay lay perfectly still, listening to the voice
that she loved, and comprehending only that this woman
she had always thought so favoured, so lucky, so above
the storms that beset her own course, was in trouble, and
that it eased her mind to talk to her—The Girlie Girl
of the music-halls. She, Fay, had been entrusted with
her secret, and her heart swelled with a pride that made
her for a few minutes forget her own tragedy. “Dead
common,” she called herself, she was Claudia’s confidante.
If Claudia wanted her to keep on fighting—well, it must
be done, somehow or other.</p>

<p>“Life can’t be a joke of the gods,” went on Claudia.
“It’s the fashion nowadays to pretend that it is—but it
can’t be. One can’t simply give way to every temptation
with the excuse that one is unhappy, that life has
cheated you. If nobody wants you to be loyal to them,
you must be loyal to yourself. Oh! how I wish I understood
things better.”</p>

<p>There was a click of the door-handle and the nurse
came in.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Currey, the cook has got some soup and cold
chicken for you in the dining-room. You must be tired
after travelling. Won’t you take a little?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Fay, rubbing her fists in her eyes, “she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
must. She’s a duck to come so quickly. Nurse, I’m
going to be good after this; at least, I’m going to make
a try. It isn’t much in my line, but I’m not so old I
can’t learn a new song and dance.... Claudia, send old
Jumbo to me.”</p>

<p>At that instant “old Jumbo” put his head dubiously
round the door. He was the weakest of husbands and
men, but helped by Colin’s lecture, he had almost overcome
his repugnance to a sick-room. The last two days
had frightened him out of his very limited wits. He had
not heard Fay sobbing for the last quarter of an hour.
Had Claudia got her asleep or——</p>

<p>“Hallo, Jumbo,” called out Fay. “Come over here
and give me a kiss.”</p>

<p>His stupid, handsome face brightened, and some of the
scared look disappeared from the eyes.</p>

<p>“Cheer oh, Fay, old girl!” he said huskily. “I’m glad
you’re better.”</p>

<p>Claudia and the nurse left the strange married couple
together.</p>

<p class="tb">At that same moment Colin was tearing open a telegram
which his man said had arrived a couple of hours
previously. It was from Pat at Le Touquet, and Colin
quickly mastered the disquieting contents.</p>

<p>“<i>Come back quickly and bring Neeburg if possible.
Gilbert has had a seizure. Would play eighteen holes.
Tried to stop him. Don’t alarm Claudia. No immediate
danger.</i>”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br />
<span class="smaller">A SICK MAN’S FANCY</span></h3>

<p>From the day that Gilbert was brought back to
England, some weeks later, Claudia’s life became
one of deadly rustic monotony. Neeburg had not been
surprised at the seizure. Cardiac trouble not infrequently
followed on neglected influenza, he said, and combined
with his nervous breakdown was, though not actually
dangerous to his life, serious enough to make, for a time,
a complete invalid of him. He was kept lying in his bed
until he was well enough to be moved from Le Touquet,
and then, in answer to his mother’s entreaties—she still
seemed vaguely to hold Claudia responsible—he went
down to his old home at Wynnstay.</p>

<p>It was out of the question for him to continue living in
London for some time to come, and Neeburg approved of
the air of Wynnstay, which was pure and bracing. It was
situated on the Sussex Downs, and from the topmost windows
a glittering streak, which was the sea in the distance,
could be glimpsed.</p>

<p>Life had not been any too cheery during those last
weeks at Le Touquet, but at Wynnstay Claudia felt as
though she were in prison.</p>

<p>It was <em>his</em> home, and Claudia was made to feel that
though the wife of the sick man, she was an outsider.
Gilbert’s moroseness had increased, and rank bitterness
was in his heart. Sometimes Claudia fancied that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
looked at her with furious envy in his eyes as she came
with her springy steps across the lawn to where he was
stretched out under a big tree. He did not wish to see
any of their friends—was it the same reason, envy of their
health?—so that very few people came to the house.
Sometimes Lady Currey made it plain that instead of
tramping along the country lanes, which was her one
solace—there were no golf-links near—Claudia ought to
appear in the sedate, sunless drawing-room with its cabinets
of valuable china, and make small talk for the wife
of the vicar and the sister of the curate, and listen to
genteel opinions on a variety of subjects—no one could
say even the biggest were shirked—of which the exponents
knew less than nothing.</p>

<p>Sometimes Claudia felt she was shriveling into a polite,
well-bred mummy. Gilbert expected her to write all his
letters for him—he still kept in touch with his office—so
that he resented her wishing to go up to town even for
the day. She knew it was unreasonable, but after a while
she ceased to care very much.</p>

<p>Lady Currey had always disliked Patricia, whom privately
she characterized as “a loud, indecently large
hoyden,” and she made this so plain that Claudia could
not urge Pat to come down to visit her. Indeed, with
the Currey family she had no rights at all, either to personal
friends or opinions. Any views which she was
sometimes exasperated into expressing were generally
received in chilly silence.</p>

<p>Sick people are notoriously capricious in their likes and
dislikes, and Gilbert seemed to have taken a dislike to
Colin. They had been together quite amiably at Le
Touquet, but once at Wynnstay, Gilbert never suggested
that he should come down, and once, when Colin motored
down, received him in such an indifferent manner that
no one could have misunderstood. Then, at the beginning
of July Colin had gone up to Lancashire to pursue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
some investigations on the Child Labour problem for Sir
Michael Carton, and since then Claudia had only had letters
from him. The letters were always charming, unobtrusively
encouraging and subtly sympathetic, telling her
something of his work and discussing the books in the
Currey library, which helped to while away her time, but
she missed him. She wondered why he and Pat did not
announce their engagement, and therefore she was not
in the least surprised when she got the following letter
from Pat one morning in August:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I <em>must</em> see you, old girl, so I’m coming down for the
week-end, and, like the improper female your mother-in-law
thinks me (Oh! what would she think of a really
improper female? But there, I suppose really improper
females can’t afford to behave improperly, they have to
prune and prism), I have taken rooms at the Three Compasses
Inn in the village. They’ve got a ducky room—it
looks out on the duck-pond and they will quack me a
matutinal lay—which I investigated last time I came
down to see you for the day. Socky shall chase the ducks,
and I’ll eat any he kills, or send them, with his compliments,
to Lady Currey. But I must see you. I’ve been
keeping a secret from you for some time, and I’m nearly
dead of spontaneous combustion. Perhaps it’s too late
and you’ll only find a coat and skirt—the other lingerie
oddments would, I’m sure, be combusted, too—when you
meet the 1.15 train. It’s a <em>great, great secret</em>, but everything
is settled now. Colin will come down for the day
on Sunday and help to eat one of the ducks. Now curiosity
shall smoulder in thee!</p>

<p>“Have you heard that Frank Hamilton has married a
study in yellow?—yellow in her pockets and yellow in
her face—called Maria Jacobs, and she has taken a house
in Belgrave Square? Rhoda, who knows all things indecent,
says he made her settle a large sum of money on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
him and then announced his intention of travelling in the
East—without her. She herself—Rhoda, I mean—is
very annoyed. With great difficulty she got hold of a
new man—vastly rich—who met her husband and became
interested in his plays. He is putting up the money for
a show in the autumn, and Rhoda hasn’t got a look-in.
Funny world, isn’t it?</p>

<p>“Wave a Union Jack on the platform on Saturday, and
I will fall out on top of Socky.</p>

<p class="center">“Thine,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Pat</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Lady Currey did not like letters to be read at breakfast—she
insisted that Claudia should have the meal
downstairs—so she had had to keep it until she could
stroll forth in the garden. Well, Pat’s secret wasn’t such
a great secret, after all. Claudia smiled as she wondered
why it is that couples in love never imagine that anyone
else notices! She wished Pat every happiness, every
happiness——</p>

<p>She broke off a fragrant red rose and buried her face
in it. It filled her nostrils with the sweetness and fragrance
of life. It meant beauty, youth, happiness! Those
things were for Pat, not for her. Then the rose recalled
her last meeting with Frank and the little dinner-table.
He was not finding youth and beauty with Maria Jacobs,
he was finding what apparently he had always wanted—money.
Well, he had made no wound in her heart, it had
been mere physical attraction.</p>

<p>Then she heard Lady Currey speaking. “I think it is
very dangerous to inhale the perfume of flowers so near
one’s nose. I read in a book once that it may affect one’s
brain. Besides, there are often earwigs and things.”</p>

<p>Claudia held out the rich, red bud. “Isn’t it beautiful?
Would you like me to fill that empty rose-bowl for you?”</p>

<p>“John does not like the smell of flowers in the house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
I always have to see that there are scentless ones on the
table, and really”—plaintively—“it is quite difficult.”</p>

<p>Claudia looked at her. She was extraordinarily well
preserved, even in the bright morning light. There were
no lines to tell her age or mark character. But it was not
a face that invited confidence, that would attract a child
or make a precious miniature in any man’s heart.</p>

<p>“And, of course, you always consider his wishes in
every way, even small ones?”</p>

<p>Lady Currey looked at the red rose laid lovingly—fearless
of earwigs—against the soft, creamy cheek. The
months spent in the country had, from a physical point
of view, been greatly to Claudia’s advantage. Forced to
go to bed early and roam the country lanes and fields,
she looked the picture of health and strength. The face
was now a little sad in repose, too thoughtful for her age,
the lips had a faint droop, she did not laugh so readily
and so gaily as before she was married; but no one could
look at her and not admire her glowing beauty, her lissome,
finely-moulded body instinct with vitality and magnetism.
As she stood on the lawn in her simple white
linen frock with a big black velvet bow at her throat, she
made Lady Currey look like an expressionless china doll.</p>

<p>“Women were meant to study their husband’s wishes.
I know, of course, that modern women like yourself no
longer practise that creed—a creed, I may add, laid down
in the Bible. I am told that women make a great point
of being independent. But have they gained man’s respect
by it? I ask you that. How do men speak of
women nowadays? But lightly, I fear.”</p>

<p>“Did men ever respect women very much?” said
Claudia gently, tucking the rose into her white leather
belt. “If men really respected women, would it be necessary
either loudly to demand independence or for them
to <em>study</em> men’s wishes? Women have been in subjection
for ages—not satisfactory; it is now freedom and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
independence—not satisfactory. Perhaps the third phase
will be happier for both.... Colin Paton is coming
down for the day on Sunday. I suppose Gilbert would
like to see him?”</p>

<p>Claudia could not help noticing that Lady Currey
looked at her rather sharply. “Did <em>you</em> ask him down?”</p>

<p>“No. As a matter of fact my sister is staying in the
village for the week-end, and he is coming down—for
her.”</p>

<p>Lady Currey’s mouth dropped open a little and she
stopped snipping at the roses.</p>

<p>“Oh! is he? Then he doesn’t——? That will make
a difference. Gilbert will be certain to want to see him.”</p>

<p>Claudia’s curiosity was aroused. Lady Currey did not
often cut her sentences.</p>

<p>“‘That will make a difference’ ... why do you say
that? What will make a difference?”</p>

<p>“You mean me to deduce that he is—er—interested in
your sister? Yes, quite so. Of course, when people are
ill they have curious ideas. I never believed it possible
myself. His mother is a good woman, I believe, though
she is not High Church, and I have always thought highly
of Colin Paton. Of course, as John says, it is a thousand
pities that he has got drawn into the net of these mad
Socialists, and if I were his mother——”</p>

<p>“What fancy has Gilbert got into his head?” interrupted
Claudia, looking over to the other side of the lawn,
where her husband was reading the newspaper. He was
now much better, and could walk half a mile or so.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing much, only—he fancied—that you saw
too much of Colin Paton. He—he imagined Mr. Paton
was in love with you, but I was sure he had too much
respect for himself to fall in love with a married woman.”</p>

<p>Claudia stared at the prim little face for a moment, and
then she commenced laughing. Gilbert jealous! Why,
he had never troubled a scrap about Frank Hamilton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
he had never noticed Charles Littleton’s devotion, nor any
of the other men who were always making love to her.
He had chosen to be jealous of the one man—almost the
only one—who had never whispered amorously in her ear.
It was too ludicrous! Yes, a sick man’s fancies are odd.</p>

<p>“Poor Gilbert!” sighed Lady Currey. “But he is much
better now. Dr. Neeburg—I wish he had been an Englishman—said
last week that he was doing splendidly,
and it is only a question of time. We shall soon have
dear Gilbert restored to health. By the by, what is this
rumour I hear that Lynch House at Rockingham has been
taken by your brother?”</p>

<p>Rockingham was some four miles away across the
downs, and Lynch House was a big, rambling old house,
with a huge, neglected garden. It had been empty for
some years.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is true. Jack has rented it for a time, and
my sister-in-law is being moved down for the rest of the
summer.”</p>

<p>Lady Currey looked her strong disapproval. “What
can a—a paralysed woman and your brother want with
such a big house? Why, it has quantities of bedrooms!
Surely, most unsuitable.”</p>

<p>“Fay has a little scheme in her head,” returned Claudia
quietly. “She wanted to be near me, that’s why she came
to Rockingham, and she wants a big house for her
scheme.”</p>

<p>“Is she going to turn it into an hotel?” said her mother-in-law
sharply, looking her dislike of <em>any</em> scheme The
Girlie Girl might have.</p>

<p>“Yes, a first-class hotel, where the guests have no bills
to pay. She’s got the idea of having some of her old
hard-working friends in the profession down for a good
holiday.”</p>

<p>She and Fay corresponded regularly. Sometimes it
was rather difficult to make out Fay’s scrawls, with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
extraordinary phonetic spelling and enormous dashes,
but they had grown into the habit of talking their thoughts
aloud to one another. Claudia was often surprised how
much Fay comprehended of what she wrote her. There
were things she said and wrote to Fay that she would
never have communicated to any other woman, not even
Pat, so that a strong link had been forged between them,
a curious bond which made life more possible for both of
them. Claudia often forced herself to be gay and cheery
when she wrote to Fay, and she read between the lines
when Fay’s jokes rang a little false. Jack wrote and told
her that Fay was too stunning for words—high praise for
him—and that she didn’t often cry now, and since she
had got the idea of being moved—it was pathetically easy,
seeing how small she was—and having some of her pals
down for a week or two at a time, to give them a good
spree, she chirped away like a sparrow about it all day
long.</p>

<p>“H’m.” Lady Currey pursed up her small mouth.
“Most unsuitable neighbourhood for such people.”</p>

<p>“It’s a very beautiful, healthy neighbourhood, and I
think it’s a splendid notion of Fay’s. I’m proud of her idea.”</p>

<p>Lady Currey was crumpling up her eyebrows when
Gilbert called out to Claudia. He wanted a book fetched
from the library. Claudia never attempted to be too
sympathetic with him, nor did she proffer any, even
friendly, caresses. Gilbert had made it so plain that he
merely considered her as a useful secretary. His father
was getting old and his son was sometimes impatient with
his slow brain; his mother was—his mother, but she could
never be trusted to find a book or look anything up for
him. But Claudia was quick and practical, and he never
had to explain anything twice.</p>

<p>After she had fetched the book she lingered irresolutely
by his chair. His hair was going very grey, and his body
had grown heavy and flabby, but in the face he looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
much healthier. His skin was a better colour, and the
circles round his eyes less pronounced. His nerves were
distinctly less ragged, he was beginning to sleep quite
well, and the cardiac symptoms had not shown themselves
for some time.</p>

<p>“Gilbert,” she said, “Colin Paton is coming down on
Sunday.... Why have you not wanted to see him? He
was awfully kind at Le Touquet. Have you ever properly
thanked him?”</p>

<p>He did not look up from the book, but she saw that
he had been listening.</p>

<p>“Oh! I think I did. Besides, didn’t you thank him?
You and he are great friends.”</p>

<p>“Do you complain of that?” How beautiful the leaves
of the copper beech were under the sun. The grass at
their feet was flecked by little jumping shadows, as the
slight wind ruffled the branches.</p>

<p>“No. I have every trust in Colin.”</p>

<p>Claudia gave a sharp exclamation, and threw up her
head. “What do you mean by that, Gilbert? Isn’t that
an extraordinary statement to make about your friend?”</p>

<p>He still kept the book open. She saw that it was a
book on Trades Unions.</p>

<p>“Why do you pretend not to understand me?” he said
coldly. “I have told you I do not object to your friendship.
Why do you pretend that you do not know Colin
is in love with you? I suppose he came to Le Touquet
partly to be with you. Wasn’t it he who suggested you
should come?”</p>

<p>“No, it was Mr. Littleton.... You are absurdly mistaken.
Why is it men will never believe in a man-and-woman
friendship? Colin is in love with my sister.”</p>

<p>She expected to see him start, but he did not. He did,
however, look at her, with a curious, critical, upward gaze.</p>

<p>“Did he tell you so?”</p>

<p>“No, but—I know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>“Really!” But the tone lacked conviction. He commenced
to turn over the pages of the book.</p>

<p>It was only a sick man’s fancy; it must be. And yet
Gilbert had had no other kind of irrational fancies. He
had remained his old egotistical self, multiplied by about
four. Her voice was a little agitated as she put her next
question.</p>

<p>“Gilbert, I wish to know something. It is only fair
you should answer it, as you made—a statement. What
gave you the idea that—that Colin cared more for me
than as a—friend?”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. “I have been trained to
observe men and women, and my observations of Colin
lately—I had nothing to do at Le Touquet except watch
such things, which, as a rule, do not interest me—coupled
with one or two facts, such as his going away as soon as
our engagement was announced, and that he has not
married, have led me to think that, as you put it, he cares
more for you than as a friend.”</p>

<p>Claudia drew in her breath jerkily. “But it’s Pat, I
tell you—Pat.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear it. I certainly thought he was in
love with you. But as he can marry Pat and he cannot
marry you now, I am glad to hear it.... Claudia, will
you go into the room where the periodicals are kept
and see if you can find a copy of the <cite>Fortnightly</cite>—some
time last year—which has an article entitled ‘Labour
Unrest.’ I daresay you’ve heard my father is having some
trouble in Langton. The workers in the paper-mills have
been threatening to strike for some time, and we want
to nip it in the bud. I think the article was late last
year, about October or November.”</p>

<p>Claudia moved across the lawn, her brain furiously and
chaotically working. She thought it was the heat of the
sun that made her feel confused and giddy, yet a moment
before she had not felt it.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII<br />
<span class="smaller">AROUND THE CORNER</span></h3>

<p>It was Saturday morning, and a very warm day, when
Claudia started out from the house to meet her sister.
The station was nearly a mile away through the fields.
She had refused the offer of the dog-cart, although after
she had been walking a few minutes she rather regretted
her decision. The sun at half-past twelve was grilling,
and there was hardly any breeze to stir the long grass,
rich with big ox-eyed daisies, waving red sorrel, yellow
trefoil, and all sorts of field flowers. She kept her sunshade
well over her head, but it is really very tiring to
walk in the heat on an August day.</p>

<p>She wondered why she felt so listless and depressed.
Why did she feel that life was simply a barren desert?
Probably it was the result of having to listen to the
pompous old vicar the previous night, who had engaged
in a deep but narrow discussion with Sir John on the
degeneration, ingratitude and irreligion of the working-classes.
The talk had been brought about by the dissatisfaction
in the mills at Langton, some ten miles off,
from which Sir John derived a large part of his very
handsome income, and as Claudia had listened, she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
wondered with a mild amusement what Colin would think
of the views expressed around the Currey tablecloth.</p>

<p>She ought not to be depressed when Pat—jolly, good
natured Pat—was coming down to see her, and she tried
to be severe with herself as she swept through the grasses.
She must not be gloomy when Pat was coming down to
announce her engagement. True, her own experience of
married life had not been ideal, but Colin was different,
and anyway, one had no right to dash the hopes of the
newly-engaged. Some married couples are happy. She
must be glad. She <em>was</em> glad. If it were not that inflated
windbag, the vicar, it must be the remembrance of her
own happy anticipations when she had first become engaged
to Gilbert that made her feel blue. The sun to-day
did not seem brilliant and wonderful, but only tiresomely
hot. The long, luscious grass was not an exquisitely soft
carpet, but only rather long for walking. The station
was not one mile away, but many miles.</p>

<p>At last, however, the little sleepy station was reached,
and she sank with a sigh of relief on one of its wooden
seats.</p>

<p>Pat and Socky did fall out together, and then Socrates,
being a friendly and remembering beast, nearly knocked
Claudia down in his demonstration of joy at seeing her
and being once more on <i lang="la">terra firma</i>.</p>

<p>“Socky, shut up, you beast.... Look out, Claud, he’ll
break your string of pearls.... My dear, you are blooming!
If I could burst into poetry—Socky, leave my
ankles alone—I should say you were like a red, red rose,
or an apple-tree, or something equally unlike a woman....
Socky, come away from that pond. Can’t you see Auntie
Claudia has got on a nice, white muslin frock? Darling,
I’m awfully glad to see you.”</p>

<p>How boyish Pat looked in her grey linen coat and skirt,
and neat white silk collar and tie. It seemed almost
absurd, the idea of her getting married. One could easier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
imagine her having a wrestling bout with her lover, as did
a certain Cornish heroine of fiction. If she had been
espousing some happy-go-lucky, high-spirited youth of
her own age it would have seemed more feasible—but
Colin Paton!</p>

<p>“Mother has become a Roman Catholic,” chattered Pat,
“or she is going to become one when there’s a vacancy,
or however they do it. Why? Oh! she’s tired of the
professional spooky people, and she now finds that the
‘greatest and only true mysticism’—her words, not mine—is
to be found in religion. She’s going into retreat, she
says. As a matter of fact, I suspect she is going to have
a new skin treatment that Rhoda is raving about, and
which takes three weeks, during which time you have to
lie <i lang="fr">perdu</i>. She is going to pray for all of us and repent
very picturesquely of her sins in purple and grey, not
being able to commit quite so many now. She says that
her liking for incense foreshadowed this. I told her she
couldn’t become Saint Circe and pose in a stained-glass
window, however much she tried; but her new rôle is to
be very patient, oh! so sweet and patient.” Pat laughed.
“She isn’t a bad sort really—she stumped up for all my
bills the other day—only why on earth does she want to
pose so much? Ah! the ‘Three Compasses!’ That’s
the ducky window—dost see? If there were anyone
impressionable about I should do the sentimental act
from that window. He would call ‘Let down your hair,
let down your hair, Patricia,’ in a sepulchral voice, and I
should carefully remove about twenty hairpins, two side-combs
and a piece of tape, and then lean out with a
fatuous smile.”</p>

<p>“Well, Colin is coming down to-morrow, you tell me.
No doubt he will oblige.”</p>

<p>Pat shook her head. “He’s too sensible for those
tricks. Besides, he doesn’t admire fair hair. I will not
let down my hair to a man who prefers dark hair.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>They entered the inn, and were shown up to a quaint-shaped,
homely bedroom.</p>

<p>“Pat, Lady Currey graciously extended an invitation
to you for lunch to-day, but I told her a fib. I said I was
engaged to you for lunch here.... Now, tell me the—secret.”</p>

<p>“In a minute.... Do you like apples, lots and lots of
apples? Would you like to be buried in apples, rosy-cheeked,
luscious apples?” Pat grinned at her sister as
she threw off her coat and commenced to wash her hands.</p>

<p>“I like them tolerably,” smiled Claudia, watching the
noisy ducks waddling in the pond. “But why——?”</p>

<p>“You’ll like them intolerably soon. Wait till they arrive
in barrels! But, as the novels say—I anticipate. Over
lunch I will to thee impart the great news. Glory! Hallelujah!
there’s an imitation of a bathroom. I shall have to
bath in instalments, but I had awful visions of an egg-cup
in my bedroom. No, wait till we’ve started lunch.”</p>

<p>“I can guess one thing,” said Claudia, with a slight
effort. “You are going to leave home. The house of
Circe will soon be empty of her children.”</p>

<p>“It will. Where’s that wild beast gone to? He mustn’t
kill <em>all</em> the ducks. Oh, here he is! You idiot, that’s a
turnip. Turnips don’t need catching. You are discredited
as a sportsman. Anyone can catch a turnip....
Well, do you remember the talk we had when I said
matrimony was not for me and you pretended not to
believe me?”</p>

<p>“And now——”</p>

<p>“Now I’m sure of it. Look at me well, Claudia. I am
a woman to be respected. Here at this table behold a
farmeress! Salute her with the gravy-spoon!”</p>

<p>“A what!”</p>

<p>“A farmeress—feminine of farmer. I am the legal
owner of a fruit-farm in Canada, and another of England’s
unemployed will, at the beginning of next month,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
emigrate and leave the sinking ship. It’s rude to stare,
my dear sister. Isn’t it a brilliant idea? Alone I did it.
At least, no. I got the idea and Colin Paton helped me to
get the farm and see that it was genuine and above-board.
Why, Claud, old girl, what’s the matter?”</p>

<p>For suddenly Claudia found herself half laughing, half
crying, and nearer hysterics than she had ever been in her
life. She had a silly, light-headed sort of feeling that she
could not account for. She seemed suddenly freed from
a suffocating sensation that had oppressed her lately. She
had never before experienced the sensation of wanting
to laugh and cry at the same time. Indeed, she had
always despised people who got so muddled in their
emotions. But though she made an effort to keep on
laughing—there was nothing really to cry about—the
tears ran down her cheeks.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Pat.... It’s being shut up with the
Curreys and the strike, I think.... Oh! Socky!” For the
dog, very perturbed, was standing with his feet on her
shoulders, showering moist kisses upon her. “Socky, go
away ... give me some water ... all over.”</p>

<p>Pat surveyed her anxiously, and she saw that although
her sister’s physical health seemed perfect, her eyes were
those of a woman who lies awake at night thinking.</p>

<p>“Claudia, old girl, you want a change. Come to Canada
with me next month. Do—it will do you a lot of good.”</p>

<p>Her sister shook her head and absent-mindedly wiped
her eyes on the serviette. “Go on, tell me more about it.”</p>

<p>Then Pat, her eyes shining with excitement, told how
an article on the future of women as fruit-farmers in
Canada had fired her with a desire to do something real,
as she expressed it, to get out of the smug, bandboxy
life she was living. She had consulted Colin, who encouraged
her, and all through the summer they had been
investigating various farms that were for sale, and only
a few days ago had they finally settled on one in the Winnipeg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
district. “Colin was no end of a help to me,” concluded
Pat, “because, of course, I should have been done
in the eye like Martin Chuzzlewit was. But this is a
good farm and belongs to a woman who wants to give it
up, but she has consented to stop with me as long as I
want her, so I can learn the whole box of tricks. Claudia,
I know I shall love it. That’s what I meant by apples
just now. I shall send you barrel-loads, simply barrel-loads.”</p>

<p>Claudia asked if their father and mother had given
their consent, though Patricia was of age and had her
own income.</p>

<p>“Yes, in a sort of way. They think I’ll come back in
a few months, but I shan’t. I told you long ago I was a
throw-back. I love the earth and all that pertains to it,
and what’s the good of wasting my youth and energies in
what the papers call Society? It’s all right for those
who like it. I’m not slinging any adjectives at it; but I’m
not made that way. I want more scope. But, seriously,
will you sail with me next month for a holiday to see me
settled?”</p>

<p>“I should love it, but you see—I’ve got a husband.”
Then, half-smilingly, yet with a touch of sarcasm, she
added, “I’ve become useful to him, Pat. He complimented
me the other day on my neatness and method
in arranging some documents for him.”</p>

<p>Pat walked to the little window and said something to
herself that was very like “Damn!”</p>

<p>“But he’s better, isn’t he?” she said, turning round
again. “I shall never forget how scared I was when
they got him back to the hotel at Le Touquet. They had
to support him on the grass-roller. I was afraid he was
dead, he looked so awful. I begged him not to go on
playing, but you might as well ask an elephant to tread
in a whisper. It was that climb up to the fourteenth
that did it. But his heart is all right again now? Does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
one quite get over a thing like that? It’s all vague to
me. What’s the anatomy of a heart? Does something
heal up?”</p>

<p>“He will have to be more careful than formerly not to
over-exert himself or get excited. But Neeburg says
there are many people with worse trouble who live to be
ninety. But let’s come out into the sunshine and sit under
a tree!” She went to the door which opened on the small
garden. “Oh! isn’t it a glorious day! Come and tell me
more about the apples!”</p>

<p>As Claudia went back to Wynnstay that night she wondered
what she could tell Gilbert about the mistake she
had made. Was it necessary to go up and gratuitously
inform him that Colin was not engaged to Pat? She had
made a blunder. Ought she to correct a wrong impression?
Was it a wrong impression on anyone but herself?
Gilbert’s attitude had certainly been one of quiet scepticism.</p>

<p>The sun was setting, and the earth was very peaceful
and restful after the hot day, as she walked up the long
approach to the house. Now she was alone, she ought
to be able to think out why Pat’s unexpected secret had
moved her so strangely. But somehow, she had no want
to probe into her feelings to-night. She only knew she
felt happier than she had done for a long time. But then,
Pat was a cheering person, she would have enlivened
a graveyard. She hummed a little song as she walked,
the drowsy birds twittering a half-hearted accompaniment.</p>

<p>Pat and Colin came to lunch with them next day, for
though Pat had made a hideous grimace at the prospect,
she had ultimately agreed that she had better pretend to
be a well-behaved person. She had urged Claudia to go
with her to the station to meet Colin, but her sister had
for some reason undefined, even to herself, pleaded the
heat and the distance. Besides, was he not really coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
down to see Pat? Not in a lover-like way, but still to see
her. Was he? Was he?</p>

<p>She took out his last letter from Manchester. Somehow
it seemed to read differently from the day she had
received it.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“When are we going to forgather?” it ran. “Letters
are always so inadequate. I have crowds of things to
tell you, and why don’t you write more about yourself?
Your account of life at Wynnstay was most amusing. I
could picture the deadly regularity of its clockwork, but
what about the alien in its midst? Has she become a
carefully adjusted machine too? I know what it must
be to live with the Curreys day after day, and I wish I
could help you in some way. I am sending you down
a couple of books I think you will like, and a newspaper-cutting
in which you will see I am described as an earnest,
middle-aged man! Rather a blow, that! I wonder if I
do impress people that way? Of course, it was probably
written by some reporter at the back of the hall, but—’tis
a horrid thought. Earnest! Middle-aged! I’ve still
got two thirties to spare....”</p>

</div>

<p>At lunch—or, as Sir John would insist on everyone
calling it, luncheon—she did not sit next to him or have
an opportunity for any private conversation. She had to
be content with a long look and a smile. The vicar and
his wife always dined with them on Sunday, and there
were two or three other people, quite uninteresting, but
very chatty. Claudia wondered vaguely why uninteresting
people generally are chatty.</p>

<p>It was not until nearly four that Claudia found herself
free to talk to Colin, and she had been sitting so long that
she jumped to her feet as the vicaress was lost to sight.</p>

<p>“Let’s go for a little stroll before tea. Colin, do you
know the view from the windmill? It’s rather jolly.
Come and see it. Get up, Pat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, mum, it’s too nerve-racking looking after Socrates.
Now he’s chained to the tree I don’t want to
disturb him. No, go thou to the view. Peradventure
thy servant will slumber a little. Those beastly ducks
and a perfectly abominable creature called a guinea-fowl
wouldn’t let me sleep this morning, and the hardness of
the bed wouldn’t let me sleep last night. These facts,
combined with an English Sunday lunch (I beg his pardon—eon)
make me what writers call somnolent. Go
away and leave me to somnol.”</p>

<p>Claudia gave a great sigh of relief as they turned out
of the gates of Wynnstay, and he looked at her with
quick sympathy.</p>

<p>“It isn’t an exhilarating existence at Wynnstay, is it?”
he said. “I know how you feel about it. But it won’t
be for much longer, I gather?”</p>

<p>“No, thank goodness. It <em>is</em> rather dreadful. I either
feel perfectly comatose or so irritably alive that I want
to scream. Don’t let us talk about it. Let me tell you
how glad I am at the success of your book. What a
magnificent notice you had in the <cite>Times</cite>. Don’t you feel
on top of yourself?”</p>

<p>“I won’t pretend that I’m not glad. But, honestly, it
has been rather a surprise. I had a horrible feeling all
the time I was writing it that it was <i lang="fr">vieux jeu</i>, that it
had all been said before. It is charming to find people
so appreciative,” he concluded modestly.</p>

<p>“You’ve waited and done something worth doing,” said
Claudia slowly. “That was prophesied of you long ago.”</p>

<p>“My waiting was pure laziness,” he said lightly. “The
silent man is not always the wise one, though he does look
unutterables.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad, I’m very, very glad,” said his companion
simply. “It gives me quite a thrill when I read
the notices. Now tell me about Pat and her farm.”</p>

<p>Claudia found that he had gone into the whole matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
very thoroughly, as he did everything he took up, and
that Pat, through him, had made a very sound and promising
bargain.</p>

<p>“And you approve of Pat going out there?” she said.
“It sounds rather mad. Suppose I took a craze in my
head to go out to Canada and farm, would you do all this
for me and pack me off with your blessing?”</p>

<p>He laughed. “You and Pat are two very different
propositions. Besides, you are not a bachelor like Pat.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>There was a slight pause.</p>

<p>“Pat doesn’t seem to want to marry. She snaps her
fingers at your sex.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that will come later on. She’ll marry right
enough one day, when the right man comes along. Pat
isn’t unfeminine or a crank.”</p>

<p>Claudia shot a sideways glance at him as they walked
in step together. They were passing a hedge fragrant
with honeysuckle and she stopped and picked a piece.</p>

<p>“Do you know—oh! do you mind getting that top
piece—I once thought you had a—a fancy for her.”</p>

<p>He looked down at her, honeysuckle in hand, a curious
twinkle in his grey eyes. “I’m very fond of Pat, but not
as a wife, thank you. I’m neither old enough nor young
enough for her. Middle-age would not mate well with
the Amazon.”</p>

<p>“What ridiculous nonsense! The reporter was blind.
You don’t look middle-aged.... Are you ever going to
take a wife, Colin? Thank you. Doesn’t it smell sweet?”</p>

<p>They were approaching the top of the hill on which
stood the windmill revolving very slowly, and from
whence a magnificent view of the country around could
be obtained. Perhaps the jerks in their conversation were
due to the need of economy in breathing, for the climb
was fairly steep.</p>

<p>“Do you insist on my marrying?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>“No ... of course not.... Isn’t it hot? Why did I
choose this walk? But most men get married sooner or
later, and—you—don’t dislike women, do you? You’re
not unmasculine or a crank! But as a matter of fact,”
she added recklessly and breathlessly, “I’d rather you
didn’t, I think.”</p>

<p>She thought he gave a little exclamation, but she could
not be sure.</p>

<p>“Why would you rather—I didn’t?”</p>

<p>“Married friends are never the same as before they
were married. Oh! here we are at the top at last! Isn’t
the view worth the climb? No, please, don’t get married.
I—I don’t want you to.”</p>

<p>What was she saying? She hardly knew, except that
it was the truth, the plain, unvarnished truth. She had
really <em>hated</em> the idea of his marrying anyone, even Pat.
There was something in the air this warm summer afternoon
that made her take a reckless joy in saying the
things she should have decently hid.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t want you to,” she repeated, suddenly raising
her eyes to his as they stood side by side, each apparently
a little breathless still.</p>

<p>She found he was looking at her and the quiet strength
of his face was all broken up. The eyes looked at her as
they had looked once before. When? When she had
been flirting with Frank Hamilton at her mother’s.</p>

<p>And suddenly she knew.</p>

<p class="tb">It was as though something that had always been hiding
round the corner for many years unexpectedly came
into view. And with the knowledge came a rush of joy,
so great, so overpowering, that she reeled. Instinctively
she put out her hands and he took them in his.</p>

<p>“Colin, I never knew until just this minute. Isn’t it
curious.... I’m so glad, so glad.”</p>

<p>The hands held hers very tightly, the warm, capable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
hands that had always held her heart so safely, so
securely, if she had only known it. He was looking at
her as though he could never look enough. She knew
now the love that she had wanted so badly, so desperately,
had been at her side all the time, faithful, tender, and,
what means so much to a woman, understanding.</p>

<p>The scent of the honeysuckle, delicately persistent over
the other field flowers, was around them both. The windmill
across the field was giving slow, rheumatic creaks.
A bird was chirping noisily in the bushy hedge.</p>

<p>“Claudia, you can’t mean that you——”</p>

<p>“Yes.... I think I have always loved you, only I didn’t
realize it. The very strength of my love made it so
quiet that I didn’t notice it. When you are a girl you
imagine that love will come with a great stir and noise,
with a flourish of trumpets, so that all your senses will be
deafened, and you will be bound a captive. One doesn’t
think of it as a great, noiseless, silent thing.” She gave a
queer little laugh that was a half sigh. “One always
expects the big drum, a sort of circus, in fact.... Oh,
my dear! I’m so glad I know. That’s all I can think of
now.”</p>

<p>As she looked at him she saw that his love for her had
taken its toll. There were little lines round the eyes—lines
of repression, of unsatisfied desire that had not been
there when she first knew him. He had suffered in that
year in the Argentine when, because he was very human,
he could not bear the sight of her happiness, when he had
fled from her. He had schooled himself to be her friend,
to aid her whenever she should call upon him, after that
year, but it had not been done easily. Most men would
have ridden away, unable to fulfil the demands of friendship,
unwilling to bear the continued sting which the
sight of her brought them. She saw now that his one aim
had always been to make her happy, he himself had
always come in a poor second. Gilbert had wanted her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
to make him happy, and she had chosen—Gilbert!</p>

<p>“Oh, Colin!” she cried, “I don’t deserve that you should
have gone on caring for me all this time.”</p>

<p>“Claudia, I can’t believe it. I’ve hungered for your
love so long that, like a starving man, I can’t eat. I tried
to be content with your friendship. I tried not to think
of you in any other way, even when——”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>How steady and tender her eyes were.</p>

<p>“Even when I knew you were not happy. I’d given up
all hope. I had almost made myself believe I was content
with your platonic affection.”</p>

<p>She laughed a little mischievously.</p>

<p>“Shall I take my love back? Ah, no! I couldn’t. It’s
been out of my keeping so long. Yes, it’s true, Colin.”
She blushed hotly. “I will be honest. I have felt passion
for two other men, Gilbert—I thought that was passion
born of love—and another. But the best part of me has always
mated with you, always loved you. And yet I didn’t
discover it until I thought you were going to marry Pat.”</p>

<p>The word <em>marry</em> sobered both of them a little, but did
not detract from their happiness.</p>

<p>“Colin,” she said gently, “why did you let me marry
Gilbert? I asked you once before in a different form. I
think—I am almost sure, I was ripe for love in those old
days when we used to poke round picture-galleries and
book-shops together. I was always perfectly happy with
you. Didn’t that mean love? Why didn’t you tell me?”</p>

<p>“My dear, I wanted to give you plenty of time. Perhaps
it was a mistake, but I felt it was your due. You
were so young, so beautiful, such a success in Society,
that I wanted you to have every chance. I’m nothing in
particular, and I didn’t feel it was fair to press my suit
until you’d got to know what the world and men were
like. You see, you were always a little romantic, idealistic,
enthusiastic, and such women as you are difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
to woo fairly. One is afraid to take advantage of you.
Because we were good chums didn’t necessarily mean
that you could be happy with me as a husband.”</p>

<p>“And yet isn’t friendship, comradeship, the best foundation
for marriage?”</p>

<p>“Some people say yes, some say no. I suppose one
can’t generalize. It depends on temperament, age, experience,
many things. I adored you, but that was natural.
There were any amount of men who adored you. I
thought I knew those you were at all likely to marry.
Oh! I watched carefully, sometimes agonizedly. And
then, as you turned them down one by one, I began to
hope.... Your engagement to Gilbert came as a bomb-shell.
Gilbert, my old college friend! Why, I was hardly
aware you knew him, except that you had been neighbours
as children.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t.... He just carried me off my feet. I can’t
think, even now, how it happened ... a sort of intoxication—youth,
music, passion. In those days he was very
much the male animal, and you see ... it was the flourish
of trumpets ... I was deafened ... I thought it was
the real thing, just because I was moved. When will
women learn that the men who move them physically are
not always the men they really love? No one can say I
was brought up ignorantly; there were certain broad-minded,
lax ideas I grew up with side by side, but I didn’t
know. I thought it was love, because I liked the feeling
of his arms around me. The two things are so horribly
alike at crucial moments. If only they were differently
dressed!”</p>

<p>“I know.... I never moved you that way.”</p>

<p>“You never tried. If I had once thought of you as a
possible lover ... who knows? At least, I have learned
what a large part a woman’s imagination plays in the
game of love, but the woman is poor indeed who finds
nothing for her imagination to feed on after marriage....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
Why,” she exclaimed in wonderment, “I can’t imagine
life without you. As I look back I see that our friendship
has been a thread in my life for years, and I really
believe the whole fabric would fall to pieces without it.
Unconsciously I have always turned to you, always applied
your standards to things.”</p>

<p>“Claudia!”</p>

<p>“Yes.... I think <em>you</em> saved me from a terrible mistake....
You said I wasn’t to speak of it. But I must now,
just this once, then it goes into the realm of things utterly
forgotten. You remember the night you found me on the
stairs.... I expect you guess somewhere near the truth.
Don’t look like that. It was as much my fault as his.
I was ready to snatch at anything to fill my life. I
thought I could—but I couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t have made any difference to me,” he said
steadily. “I should have understood the reasons that
drove you to it.”</p>

<p>She looked at him, and marvelled that what he said <em>was</em>
true.</p>

<p>“But I’m glad,” she whispered, “that I—couldn’t. It
would have made a difference to <em>me</em>. I think we should
not have been standing here now. It wouldn’t have
lasted, I should have gone on plunging.... Let me tell
you something. That night your card was on the mantelpiece
in the studio. I picked it up, and from that moment
my mood changed. Somehow you seemed in the room
with us.... Then I hated the way he had painted me.
I knew you wouldn’t like it, and I wouldn’t like you to
see it exhibited. I didn’t want to be that woman—because
of you. I see it now. I didn’t understand why my mood
changed at the time. Now it’s clear to me, and I can
only marvel that I have been blind so long.” The mingled
tenderness and strength of her face were very beautiful,
as she added, “That temptation can never happen again.
I shan’t feel so restless any more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>He drew in a deep breath. “Claudia, it’s like an impossibly
sweet dream that you should be saying these
things to me. I know what you have meant to me for
years; but that I can mean anything to you! Is it all
quite real? You are sure it doesn’t come from your
generous heart, just to comfort me, now you have found
out my secret?”</p>

<p>“It’s real,” she smiled, standing in front of him, and
putting a piece of the honeysuckle in his buttonhole. “It’s
the only thing that is real in my life. Fay and I have
both been trying to fight, each in our own way—she’s
helped me too with her pluck and courage, but now this
makes the fight much easier. Now I shall go on almost
happily, because I’ve got my wish, the greatest wish in
the world.”</p>

<p>“And that is——?”</p>

<p>“To be first with the man I love. I am first, am I
not?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know? Need you ask? If—if I ever had
the chance, my one aim would be to make <em>you</em> happy,
because—a man is always selfish, you see—that would
make me happy.”</p>

<p>“And that knowledge does make me happy. You and
I belong to one another, just as much as if we were married,
wherever we are, whatever we may do.” Then she
gave a little laugh of contentment, and threw out her arms
to the countryside, so green and smiling all around them.
“This afternoon you and I, Colin, are on the top of the
hill. We’ve climbed away from the stuffy, humdrum
houses in the valleys. To-day we can shout and sing and
be glad! Do you know, I seem to hear that Sullivan
madrigal ringing in my ears, ‘All creation seems to say,
earth was made for man’s delight’—do you remember?
I am so happy, so happy. But it won’t always be as easy
as it is this afternoon. We’re of the earth, earthy. At
least, I am very earthy sometimes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>“My darling,” he cried, passionately, more moved than
he had ever been in his life, “you are the most wonderful
woman in the world!”</p>

<p>“Dearest, shall I tell you a secret in the greatest of
confidence? You won’t tell anyone? <em>I’m not.</em> I like
to think you think so, but I’m the most ‘ornery’ person,
really. I shan’t remain on the hill-top. I shall sigh and
groan and grunt inwardly, and—I shall want you just as
much as you’ll want me.... I should hate to think you
were too placid without me, I should hate to see serene,
ethereal content in your eyes.... But if you know I’m
feeling just as you are feeling, but, like you, resolutely
sitting on those feelings, it makes it easier, doesn’t it?
Sexless, unemotional people never helped anyone. And
because we look things in the face we won’t be afraid to
meet as friends; we won’t run away from our happiness
and—our pain; we won’t fret because of a mistake that
we can’t alter, will we? We’ll just make the best of
what we have, shall we?”</p>

<p>“Everything shall always be exactly as you wish,” he
said, raising her hands to his lips. For a moment she
wished that he would take her in his arms and kiss her,
just once. Then she knew that he was right. Things in
the future would be hard enough without that memory.
For this was no sudden rush of passion that she felt, so
that she longed to have his arms close round her. This
man, standing on the hill-top with her, was her mate, her
man, and naturally all that she had or was was his, by
Nature’s unalterable laws. If she could have then and
there gone away with him, there would have been no
hesitation, no fear, no breathlessness, only a joyous and
calm acceptance of the beauty that such mating would
hold for them.</p>

<p>After a while he said, “I shall go back to Manchester
to-morrow, but at any time you send me the word ‘Come,’
I shall be with you by the next train. If you feel you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
want to talk to me, if you are in any difficulty, you won’t
hesitate to send for me?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>When they arrived back at Wynnstay they found only
stewed tea, an empty cake-dish, Patricia and an unrepentant
cheerful Socrates under the trees.</p>

<p>“He demolished the plate of cakes at one fell swoop
when my back was turned, and Lady Currey has gone into
the house in disgust. She finally, I am sure, washed her
hands of the Iverson family. A little cold stew?” Her
blue eyes, at present so sexless and so keen, noted the
exaltation of the hill-top upon their glad faces, and she
raised her eyebrows as she peered into the teapot.</p>

<p>“Well, she’s tumbled to it at last,” she muttered. “And
I can go to Canada with an easy mind. I don’t care what
she does or does not do with Colin Paton.”</p>

<p>“What on earth are you muttering about, Pat?”
laughed Colin. “Is it an incantation to the Family Genie—the
teapot?”</p>

<p>Pat looked at him with a broad and bland smile.</p>

<p>“I was thinking out your epitaph, Colin Paton. But
it will keep for a few years yet.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV<br />
<span class="smaller">THE STRIKE</span></h3>

<p>In the weeks that followed, Wynnstay was galvanized
into life through the political and economic fray
brought about by the discontent at Langton. Sir John
and Gilbert talked the thing out <i lang="la">ad nauseam</i>, for Sir
John was infuriated at what he termed the ingratitude of
the mill employés whom he had kept going for so many
years. Had the Curreys even considered another point
of view than that of the capitalist it would not have been
uninteresting to Claudia to experience at close quarters
one of the big problems of the day. But all Sir John’s
narrowness and bigotry came out in the contest, so that
even Gilbert had occasionally to tell him to moderate
a little. It was most important that the men at Langton
should be conciliated and kept on his side, in order that
the seat should be safe for Gilbert, but how to do that
and at the same time enforce his will upon the men was
something of a difficulty.</p>

<p>On September the 20th practically the whole factory
went out on strike, and Sir John nearly had apoplexy in
his wrath.</p>

<p>“My mills! The mills my father had before me! The
men I’ve employed regularly in good times and bad!
It’s outrageous. Parliament ought to deal with such
things. The country is at the mercy of the Labour
party.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>“I always was against this general education,” cried
Lady Currey, examining a new piece of Sèvres she had
just acquired. “Why, one of Robson’s children is a
school-teacher.”</p>

<p>Robson was the ringleader in the strike, and a few
months before had come to loggerheads with Sir John.
One of his daughters—not the school-teacher—had gone
away from the village some four years previously, and
had recently returned with two children and no husband,
and Sir John had refused her application for an empty
cottage or to take her back again in the mill. Sir John
said, “One must uphold the principle of the thing.” But
as Claudia gradually learned, Sir John had never been
popular, and though Robson’s grievance had inflamed the
workmen, they had been in a state of ferment for some
time—partly because they had become infected with the
strike fever, and partly because Sir John refused to
replace some old machinery with the modern which is
used in most big paper mills. He was a strictly just
employer and landlord, but he did not err on the side of
leniency.</p>

<p>“I won’t give way. I won’t be intimidated by these
scoundrels. You agree with me, don’t you, Gilbert?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Gilbert’s lower lip protruded pugnaciously.
“Give way now, and you’ll have no more peace. After
all, you can afford to shut down for a time; then they’ll
come to their senses.”</p>

<p>This went on every day in different forms, explanations
to visitors all sympathetic to the Curreys, accounts in the
daily papers, until Claudia was glad to go over to Rockingham
and see Fay and her strange guests.</p>

<p>For they were very strange, according to Rockingham
ideas. Fay had asked them indiscriminately, the only
qualification being that they needed a holiday and could
not afford one. Old Joey Robins was there, watching
over Fay like a grotesque old clown in a wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
medley of garments that he imagined were suitable to the
country. He had obtained from somewhere a pair of
white flannel trousers, very much shrunk and yellow
through washing, a brown velvet coat and a grey Trilby
hat much too large for him. There was often a little mishap
with the glazed white front which would pop out of
the black waistcoat, but his celluloid collar was always
spotless. A girl who did sand-dancing and had broken
down in health, a once famous comedienne who had lost
her popularity, an acrobat who had injured his foot, and
a woman with a young baby, who had been deserted by
her husband, were her other guests on this particular
morning when Claudia went over. Fay, who was getting
very thin and hollow-eyed, gave them of her best,
for she had insisted on paying for the venture herself, and
had, for that purpose, sold all her much-loved jewellery.
“I shall never want it again,” she had said to Claudia,
biting her lips to keep back the tears.</p>

<p>Claudia had helped her to furnish the big old house
with simple, comfortable furniture, and had procured a
staff of servants to run it. And because of their liking
and pity for their odd little mistress with her extraordinary
ideas the servants stayed, though the vagaries of
the guests, the conflicting orders of Polly—“head cook
and bottle-washer,” Fay called her—and the nurses nearly
sent them distracted occasionally. When things got in
too much of a tangle Claudia’s presence was urgently
demanded.</p>

<p>On this particular morning Fay was lying out under
one of the big trees, the comedienne, a stout woman in
her sixties, with the most obvious toupée Claudia had
ever seen, sitting beside her doing “a bit of crochy.” A
little way off was the dancer, a thin, white-cheeked girl,
engaged in making a pink muslin blouse from a pattern
out of a penny journal, and snipping the bits over the
lawn. The acrobat, in full view of them all, was doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
amazing stunts on the grass for their amusement.</p>

<p>Claudia had met them all before. Behind her back she
was voted “a perfect lady, such high class, don’t you
know.” More than that, they liked and admired her.</p>

<p>“Madam, welcome!” cried the acrobat, coming towards
her performing the most extraordinary double-somersaults.
“I bow to you! I go down on the ground before
you! Hail!”</p>

<p>There was a chorus of laughs from the group under
the trees. Claudia never failed to marvel at the ease with
which they were amused.</p>

<p>“You’re too funny to live,” cried the dancer shrilly,
who was by way of having a flirtation with him. “I
don’t believe you’re no man at all. Your mother made a
mistake. You’re a piece of indiarubber.”</p>

<p>“My mother was a highly respectable lady,” returned
the acrobat, with his hand on his heart, “and her portrait
is here. It wasn’t her fault she had a genius for a son.
I say, is that a pocky-hanky for me you’re making?”</p>

<p>“No, silly, it ain’t. It’s a blawse. Do behave yourself
while Mrs. Currey’s here, or I don’t know what she’ll
think of us.... Oh! there goes the old muffin-bell for
dinner. Funny how my pecker keeps up here. I get a
hole in my bread-basket long before it’s time to
feed.”</p>

<p>“Well, my dear, you take all you want or can pocket,”
called out Fay hospitably. “No charge for a second
helping here, and the meat isn’t all gristle and bone, like
the chops the landladies get you.” There was a chorus of
assent. “If there’s anything you want, you’ve only got
to mention it.”</p>

<p>“You’re an ainjool, that’s what you are,” said the girl
emphatically. “It’s like ’Eaven to be here. It ain’t ’alf
doing me good, not much! I can pinch a bit up on my
arm now. Talk about State Insurance; you give me Fay’s
insurance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a general hearty murmur of agreement, and
they all trooped off.</p>

<p>“I can see you didn’t have a good night,” said Claudia
solicitously.</p>

<p>“No, I got the jim-jams a bit. How sweet you look
in that frock; and yet, really, it’s awfully plain, isn’t it?
Hardly anything on it except the lace collar. It’s only
really handsome people who can wear them plain things.
I always have—had to have—lots of fluff.... I say, is it
true you’re going back to town next week?”</p>

<p>“Yes. My husband is so much better that he hopes
to get back to his chambers again.”</p>

<p>“Crikey! whatever will I do? I wish you could have
stopped here.”</p>

<p>What a little face it was now under the big white
chiffon hat that Madame Rose had sent her as suitable for
the country; her idea of country being apparently drawn
from the “sets” at the halls.</p>

<p>“I’ll come down quite often, dear. Then you think of
stopping on here?” It had only been started for the
summer months.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s perfectly amazing what a lot of people want
a holiday—no bunkum either; and somehow”—she looked
round the neglected old garden; it had only been superficially
tidied up, but it was full of flowers—“I don’t want
to leave here, now I’ve come. It’s awful sweet, isn’t it?
I used to think I hated the country and that it was beastly
slow and tame, but I like to smell the flowers—different
somehow to those you have in vases—and I like to see
the birds jigging about so mighty busy over nothing.
Wouldn’t my old pals laugh at me! Fancy me watching
the birds! The only bird I ever thought of was the one
the gallery gives you sometimes. Not that the boys ever
gave <em>me</em> the bird. Once I had a little trouble with some
young fool that started to hiss in the middle of my song.
It made me that mad! I stopped right dead and I looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
up and said, ‘Well, come down here, my boy, and sing
something better.’ Ah, I got him! They started clapping
me till you couldn’t hear yourself speak. Ah, well!”</p>

<p>Claudia laid her hand on her sister-in-law’s, but Fay
was quite cheerful again when she spoke.</p>

<p>“And I think I’d like to be buried in the country; it’s
so clean and nice. Such a lot of smuts in town. Ever
been in Kensal Green? My mother’s there. They subscribed
and bought her a grave. But I can’t stand Kensal
Green; gives you the bloomingest of humps. No, I’d
like a nice, clean tombstone with bits of ivy and things.
It would be such a trouble to bring me down from town....
I don’t feel I want to be moved much more, only
from the house to the garden while it’s summer.”</p>

<p>A rush of tears blinded Claudia, for Fay said it in such
a natural, unaffected way that it was inexpressibly
pathetic.</p>

<p>“My dear! Don’t!”</p>

<p>“Oh! I am a beast to make you miserable. I didn’t
mean to, darling. Between ourselves, I shan’t be sorry
when it’s finished now. I’m ashamed of all the trouble
I am to the nurses, though they don’t complain—me, that
used to be so nippy on my feet and do everything for
myself. I’m more trouble than a baby.... Well, you
never know what you’ll come to, do you? My mother
used to say, ‘You’re born, but you’re not buried.’ She
had a bad time before she turned up her toes, poor old
thing. I might be in a worse place than this. I might
have been in one of those hospitals. Got a horror of
hospitals myself.... I told them you’d have lunch out
here with me. Here it comes.”</p>

<p>She waited until the servant had gone, then she leaned
towards Claudia and said earnestly, “I want you to
promise me something, Claudia.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Fay, what is it?”</p>

<p>“When I do the shuffle, you see that there are pars. in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
all the papers, with my photograph. You’re soon forgotten,
but that’ll wake ’em up. The Girlie Girl’s got to
have her farewell performance. I know I can trust you.
I say, these peas remind me that Polly wants to see you
about the kitchen-garden. She says the gardener is
cheating us on the peas. Never seen anyone as sharp as
she is now. She’ll count the pods every day soon. She
loves it here.”</p>

<p>Claudia spent the day there, getting glimpses into
strange ideas and modes of living, and arrived back at
Wynnstay about six. Directly she got inside the house
Lady Currey came out of the drawing-room in a very—for
her—excited state.</p>

<p>“Oh, Claudia! what do you think? We’ve just heard
that the strikers have become violent, and they are stoning
the windows of the mills and the police are powerless
to keep order. Poor John is nearly beside himself. I do
hope he’ll take care, with the stones flying about.”</p>

<p>Claudia gave an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean he has gone over to Langton?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he would go. He thought if he talked to them
he might calm them. I’m sure I don’t know. It’s all
very dreadful, something like the French Revolution.
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!”</p>

<p>Claudia from where she stood could see through the
open door of the library where Gilbert usually sat in one
of the big chairs. But the room was empty.</p>

<p>“Gilbert—where is he?”</p>

<p>“He’s gone too. He promised to look after John and
keep him calm.”</p>

<p>“What! You ought not to have let him go. When
did they start?”</p>

<p>“About four o’clock. I wanted them to wait for tea,
but they wouldn’t. It takes three-quarters of an hour to
drive over. I don’t know what the world is coming to.
I’ve always sent them a lot of things for their rummage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
sale, and last winter the blankets that I sent would——”</p>

<p>“Gilbert ought not to have gone. Why didn’t you stop
him? You know what Dr. Neeburg said. He isn’t fit to
go into a scene of excitement like that. He is just as
furious about the whole thing as his father. He is not
strong yet. How could you let him go?”</p>

<p>“He says he feels quite well now,” stammered Lady
Currey, not liking the look in her daughter-in-law’s eye.
“I told him <em>he</em> wasn’t to try and address the men.”</p>

<p>“I should think not.”</p>

<p>“They ought to be back soon,” concluded Lady Currey.
“Oh, dear! I feel so faint and queer.”</p>

<p>Claudia thought the situation over rapidly, but there
was nothing she could do. It would be no good going
over to Langton. Probably they would be returning by
now. If only Gilbert would <em>believe</em> other people occasionally!
Neeburg, when he had come down and given
Gilbert permission to go back to town, had told him emphatically
that he would still have to take things very
quietly for another year or two. And he had gone with
his father to face an infuriated rabble of strikers!</p>

<p>“Stones are so dangerous,” feebly remarked Lady
Currey, “but after all, men know best. I’ve never interfered
with my husband.”</p>

<p>Claudia said nothing more as she went to take off her
hat. She wished she had been at home. Yet, after all,
if Gilbert had made up his mind to go, would she have
been able to prevent his going? The Curreys were not
used to women “interfering,” and he was not a child.</p>

<p>It was nearly seven when she went downstairs, but the
carriage had not returned. Sir John had refused to have
the house put on the telephone, so they could get no
news. She and Billie went into the library, and she tried
to read, but it was only a pretence. Her ears were listening
for the sound of carriage-wheels. It was almost dark.
Surely they ought to be home by now. Still, a horse-brougham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
is not like a motor. The hills were rather
worse coming back.</p>

<p>At half-past seven Lady Currey came in, carefully
arrayed for dinner.</p>

<p>“Claudia, aren’t you going to dress? You’ll be late.”
Though the heavens might fall, Lady Currey would punctually
and carefully dress for dinner.</p>

<p>“I’m getting anxious,” said her daughter-in-law shortly.
“They will be late too.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m afraid so, and there’s a fish soufflé. John does
so dislike a heavy soufflé. But of course it can’t be helped.
It <em>is</em> late. You don’t think any accident has happened?”</p>

<p>“I hope not.”</p>

<p>“Claudia, do you think it is healthy to nurse a dog on
your lap? But there, he’s your dog! Oh, dear! Oh,
dear!”</p>

<p>Another quarter of an hour elapsed, and Claudia was
just getting up to do something—she hardly knew what—when
at last she heard the sound of wheels. A growing
sense of disaster lifted. The wheels had a homely, encouraging
sound. For once there was some irregularity
in the Currey <i lang="fr">ménage</i>. Claudia rushed to the door herself
and opened it.</p>

<p>She peered out into the sweet-scented darkness, but the
brougham was closed. That, at least, was wise of Gilbert,
for the night was a little chilly now.</p>

<p>“We were getting so anxious,” she called out to two
white, blurred faces she saw within. “What a long time
you have been away.”</p>

<p>Then a figure, unfamiliar to her, alighted. Surely there
were only two people in the brougham. She heard Lady
Currey behind her exclaim “Dr. Green!” in tones of surprise.</p>

<p>The man turned again to the brougham, and helped out a
very old man. As Claudia saw the limpness and dejection
of Sir John she turned sick. Something had happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>The coachman shut the door.</p>

<p>Dr. Green and her father-in-law came up the steps, the
doctor supporting the older man. Why did Sir John need
support? He was usually quite hale and hearty for his
age.</p>

<p>The coachman was making ready to drive away. Where
was Gilbert?</p>

<p>With fascinated, frightened eyes she watched the two
mount almost abreast of her.</p>

<p>Then the old man raised his eyes, as heavy and sombre
as Gilbert’s and now dark with suffering.</p>

<p>“Gil——” Claudia tried to articulate, but something
choked her.</p>

<p>“Where’s Gilbert?” said his mother behind her.</p>

<p>The eyes of the old man told her nothing, but the eyes
of the doctor were full of pity for the two women. It was
the same look as had been in the doctor’s eyes the night of
Fay’s accident. As she saw it, Claudia instinctively put
up her hand as if to ward off a blow.</p>

<p>The old man tried to explain.</p>

<p>“He <em>would</em> speak ... they’ve killed him ... wouldn’t
listen to me ... thought he could.... God have mercy
on us all!”</p>

<p>“Do you mean—he’s dead?” whispered Claudia.</p>

<p>The old man passed on heavily into the study. The
doctor answered her very gently.</p>

<p>“It was too late when I got there.... Heart failure....
I’m told he knew. Mrs. Currey, I am dreadfully
sorry.”</p>

<p>Claudia tried vainly to realize that what had been a
few hours previously was not. There was no such person
as Gilbert Currey. She, Claudia, was a widow.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV<br />
<span class="smaller">“COME”</span></h3>

<p>The windmill was creaking in the same protesting,
painful manner as Claudia climbed the hill where
she and Colin had stood more than a year ago and looked
at the view. But the waving fields of corn were all cut
now, only a yellowish stubble remained. The hedges were
beginning to show the approach of autumn, the yellowing
leaf, the reddening berry. But it looked very much the
same, just as peaceful and full of promise, though harvest-time
was over. The sun was warm, but not so hot as it
had been that Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>Claudia felt her pulses stir as she gazed around her, for
there is a richness and beauty in autumn that the earlier
months lack. She seemed to feel Nature tugging at her
sleeve, whispering in her ear, calling to her to rejoice that
the fruit of the earth was ripe, the time of waiting was
over.</p>

<p>It was more than a year since she had gone to live with
poor Fay at Rockingham, but Fay was asleep now. As
she stood there she thought of her with tears in her eyes,
and her face turned to where in the distance a cluster of
white gravestones lay bathed in the rays of the sun. By
an ironic coincidence she lay in the same churchyard as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
Gilbert, though the grass had not yet grown over the
little music-hall artiste. Death had loosened the feeble
hands that had clung so desperately—ah! how desperately
in the last few weeks!—round her neck, and that duty
was done.</p>

<p>She stood leaning against a gate, thinking a little
soberly but not unhappily of many things. Then she drew
forth a couple of letters from her pocket. The first that
she re-read was from Pat, giving her a buoyant description
of the harvesting on her farm, extolling the work and
the climate, and cataloguing with evident pride the
bushels of fruit that the trees had yielded.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Do come out, Claudia, now poor Fay has gone. There’s
nothing to keep you in England; at least, if there is, bring
the impediment with you. You must be tired out after
all the troubles of the last year. I am really very worried
about you, and if you don’t come I shall have to leave
the farm and fetch you. Colin writes me you are looking
very pulled down. You are a brick to have stuck at
Rockingham, but that’s finished now. I’m writing to
Colin by the same post. When I left I gave you to him
with my blessing! Like my cheek, wasn’t it?</p>

<p>“But, seriously, the trip would interest you, and I
won’t feed you exclusively on fruit! I think Colin would
like to see my farm. Fancy his blossoming into an M.P.
I’m so afraid he’ll lose his sense of humour in the
House....”</p>

</div>

<p>Claudia laughed a little as she put back the letter in
the pocket of her white golf-coat.</p>

<p>The windmill creaked, and the wind rustling the dry
leaves in the hedges blew her white serge skirt against her
ankles, and seemed to sing “Go! go! go!”</p>

<p>The other was from Colin. She turned to the passage
she wanted. It was on the last page.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Dearest, I don’t want to suggest any unseemly haste.
It is always for you to make the decision, and I shall understand
and acquiesce in anything you wish. Only,
sweetheart, I am a good many years older than you, and
time has cheated so many lovers. Shall we let him cheat
us of any more years? Oh! if you only knew how I
long for the time when we shall always be together, when
just a whispered ‘Claudia’ will bring you to my side!
You are with me in thought every hour of the day, but I
want your dear presence. Dearest of friends, best of
chums, when will you let me make you my wife?”</p>

</div>

<p>The wind fluttered the pages of the letter, so that she
could not read any more. The sun was warm on her
bare hand. All the earth seemed to say “Don’t delay
any longer, don’t let the gods think you are ungrateful.
Are you afraid of happiness?”</p>

<p>She raised the letter passionately to her lips.</p>

<p>“My Colin! My man!”</p>

<p>Then hastily thrusting it into her pocket, she half-walked,
half-ran down the hill to the village. Her cheeks,
a little thin from her self-imposed task, were a bright pink
with excitement, and her whole body was aglow and
superbly alive with the exercise as she pushed open a
small, clanging door at the foot of the hill. There were
oddments of sweets, toys and newspapers in the window,
and a small boy who had just purchased some sweets that
looked exactly like bootlaces stared at her in dull surprise
as she passed him with a radiant smile. She had not
just spent a whole halfpenny in two separate farthings’-worth
at the sweet-counter, so why should she look so
happy?</p>

<p>At the end of the shop was a small post-office department.
The atmosphere was stuffy, and reeked of sealing-wax
and tobacco. But the telegram would go all the
same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>The romance of all the ages, of all the world, was in
that piece of formal, ruled paper. The room might have
been perfumed with attar of roses, and the boy with the
liquorice bootlaces might have been Cupid himself! The
telegram was not going on the prosaic wires, but on the
wings of Love!</p>

<p>Yet, when it was written, it only contained two words,
beside the address:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Come. <span class="smcap">Claudia.</span>”</p>

</div>
